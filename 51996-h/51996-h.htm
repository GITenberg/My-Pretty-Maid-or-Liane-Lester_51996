<h2><a name="Publishers_Note" id="Publishers_Note">Publisher's Note</a></h2>


<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the sales
of magazines have increased tremendously
during the past five or six years, the popularity
of a good paper-covered novel,
printed in attractive and convenient form,
remains undiminished.</p>

<p>There are thousands of readers who do
not care for magazines because the stories
in them, as a rule, are short and just about
the time they become interested in it, it
ends and they are obliged to readjust their
thoughts to a set of entirely different
characters.</p>

<p>The S. &amp; S. novel is long and complete
and enables the reader to spend many
hours of thorough enjoyment without doing
any mental gymnastics. Our paper-covered
books stand pre-eminent among
up-to-date fiction. Every day sees a new
copyrighted title added to the S. &amp; S.
lines, each one making them stronger,
better and more invincible.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A DESPERATE CHANCE.</p>


<p>"How fast the river flows! How it roars in my
ears and drowns the sound of your voice, my
dearest! It is bearing me away! Oh, save me!
save me!"</p>

<p>The river was the stream of Death, and the
lone voyager floating out on its rushing tide was
a loved and loving young wife.</p>

<p>The frail white hands clung fondly to her husband's
as she rested with her head upon his breast,
and the faint voice murmured deliriously on:</p>

<p>"How it rushes on&mdash;the wild river! How it
rocks me on its broad breast! It is not so noisy
now; it is deeper and swifter, and its voice has
a lulling tone that soothes me to sleep. Hold me
tight&mdash;keep me awake, dear, lest it sweep me
away to the sea!"</p>

<p>Ah, he would have given the world to hold her
back, his darling, the dearest of his heart, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
rushing torrent was too strong. It was sweeping
her away.</p>

<p>Several days ago a beautiful daughter&mdash;her
first-born after five years' wifehood&mdash;had been
laid in her yearning arms.</p>

<p>But, alas! the first night of its birth, during a
temporary absence of the old nurse from the
room, the little treasure had been stolen from its
mother.</p>

<p>Panic seized the whole household, and rigorous
search was at once begun and kept up for days,
but all to no avail.</p>

<p>The father was frantic, but, though he would
have given his fortune for the return of the child,
he was powerless; and now, as a sequel to this
tragedy of loss and pain, his dear young wife lay
dying in his arms&mdash;dying of heartbreak for the
lost babe&mdash;poor bereaved young mother!</p>

<p>Tears rained from his eyes down on her pallid
face as he strained her to his breast, his precious
one, going away from him so fast to death, while
outside, heedless of his despair, the golden sun
was shining on the green grass, and the fragrant
flowers, and the little birds singing in the trees
as if there were nothing but joy in the world.</p>

<p>The old family physician came in softly, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
an anxious, sympathetic face, and whispered
startling words in his ear.</p>

<p>A look of aversion crossed the young husband's
face, and he groaned:</p>

<p>"Doctor Jay, I cannot bear the thought!"</p>

<p>"I feared you would feel so, Mr. Clarke, but
all my medical colleagues agree with me that
nothing but the restoration of her child can save
my patient's life. It is the desperate chance we
take when we feel that all hope is lost."</p>

<p>"Then I must consent!"</p>

<p>"You are wise," the old doctor answered, tiptoeing
from the room, only to reappear a little
later, followed by the nurse with a little white
bundle in her arms.</p>

<p>The low voice of the delirious woman went babbling
on.</p>

<p>"Darling," murmured her husband, pressing
his lips to her pale brow.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, dear, I'm going away from you.
Hark!"</p>

<p>The sudden wail of an infant had caught her
hearing.</p>

<p>Her dull eyes brightened with returning intelligence,
she moved restlessly, and the nurse laid
a wailing infant against her breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear mistress, can you hear me? Here is
your baby back again."</p>

<p>They had taken a desperate chance when all
hope seemed lost.</p>

<p>By the advice of the consulting physicians, another
child had been substituted for the stolen one,
and, at its helpless cry, hope crept back to the
mother's breaking heart; the rushing waves
ceased to moan in her ears, silenced by that little
piping voice, and the sinking life was rallied.</p>

<p>She lived, and the babe grew and throve in its
luxurious surroundings, and the mother worshiped
it. No one ever dared tell her the truth&mdash;that
it was not her own infant that had been restored
to her arms, but a little foundling. No
other child ever came to rival it in Mrs. Clarke's
love, and it was this fact alone that sealed her
husband's lips to the cruel secret that ached at his
heart. He feared the effect of the truth on his
delicate wife, taking every precaution to keep her
in ignorance, even to moving away from his own
home, and settling in a distant place.</p>

<p>Though he never relaxed his efforts to find his
lost child, the years slipped away in a hopeless
quest, and Roma, the adopted girl, grew eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
years old, and her beauty and her prospects
brought her many suitors.</p>

<p>In his heart Mr. Clarke hoped the girl would
make an early marriage, for he was tired of living
a lie, pretending to love her as a daughter to deceive
his wife, while an aching void in his own
heart was always yearning for his own lost
darling.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">FATE IS ABOVE US ALL.</p>


<p>It was six o'clock by all the watches and clocks
at Stonecliff, and the girls at Miss Bray's dressmaking
establishment hastily put up their work
and were starting for home, chattering like a flock
of magpies, when their employer called after them
testily:</p>

<p>"Say, girls, one of you will have to take this
bundle up to Cliffdene. Miss Clarke wanted it
very particularly to wear to-night. Liane Lester,
she lives nearer to you than any of the others.
You take it."</p>

<p>Liane Lester would have liked to protest, but
she did not dare. With a decided pout of her
rosy lips, she took the box with Miss Clarke's new
silk cape and hurried to overtake Dolly Dorr, the
only girl who was going her way.</p>

<p>"What a shame to have to carry boxes along
the village street late in the afternoon when every
one is out walking! I think Miss Bray ought to
keep a servant to fetch and carry!" cried Dolly
indignantly. "Oh, look, Liane! There's that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
handsome Jesse Devereaux standing on the post-office
steps! Shouldn't you like to flirt with him?
Let's saunter slowly past so that he may notice
us!"</p>

<p>"I don't want him to notice me! Granny says
that harm always comes of rich men noticing poor
girls. Come, Dolly, let us avoid him by crossing
the street."</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, Liane Lester
turned quickly from her friend and sped toward
the crossing.</p>

<p>But, alas, fate is above us all!</p>

<p>Her haste precipitated what she strove to avoid.</p>

<p>Drawing the veil down quickly over her rosy
face, the frolicsome wind caught the bit of blue
gossamer and whirled it back toward the sidewalk.
Jesse Devereaux gave chase, captured the
veil, and flew after the girl.</p>

<p>She had gained the pavement, and was hurrying
on, when she heard him at her side, panting,
as he said:</p>

<p>"I beg pardon&mdash;your veil!"</p>

<p>A white hand was thrust in front of her, holding
the bit of blue gauze, and she had to stop.</p>

<p>"I thank you," she murmured, taking it from
his hand and raising her eyes shyly to his face&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
brilliant, handsome face that had haunted
many a young girl's dreams.</p>

<p>The dazzling dark eyes were fixed eagerly on
her lovely face, and his red lips parted in a smile
that showed pearly-white teeth as he exclaimed
gayly:</p>

<p>"Old Boreas was jealous of your hiding such a
face, and whisked your veil away, but out of
mercy to mankind I concluded to return it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, very much!" she answered again,
and was turning away when Dolly Dorr rushed
across the street, breathless with eagerness.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Devereaux?" she cried
gayly, having been introduced to him at a church
festival the evening before.</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated, as he lifted his
hat, and she twittered:</p>

<p>"Miss Dorr; we met at the festival last night,
you know. And this is my chum, Liane Lester."</p>

<p>"Charmed," he exclaimed, while his radiant
black eyes beamed on Liane's face, and he stepped
along by Dolly's side as she placed herself between
them, intent on a flirtation.</p>

<p>"May I share your walk?" he asked, and Dolly
gave an eager assent, secretly wishing her girl
friend a mile away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>But as she could not manage this, she proceeded
to monopolize the conversation&mdash;an easy task, for
Liane walked along silent and ill at ease, "for all
the world," thought the lively Dolly to herself,
"like a tongue-tied little schoolgirl."</p>

<p>No wonder Liane was demure and frightened,
dreading to get a scolding from granny if Jesse
Devereaux walked with them as far as her home.</p>

<p>Liane lived alone, in pinching poverty, with a
feeble old grandmother, who was too old to work
for herself, and needed Liane's wages to keep
life in her old bones; so she was always dreading
that the girl's beauty would win her a husband
who would pack the old woman off to the poorhouse
as an incumbrance.</p>

<p>She kept Liane illy dressed and hard worked,
and never permitted her to have a beau. Marriage
was a failure, she said.</p>

<p>"What was the use of marrying a poor man,
to work your fingers to the bone for him?" she
exclaimed scornfully.</p>

<p>"But one might marry rich," suggested innocent
Liane.</p>

<p>"Rich men marry rich girls, and if they ever
notice a poor girl, she mostly comes to grief by
it. Don't never let me catch you flirting with any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
young man, or I'll make you sorry!" granny answered
viciously.</p>

<p>She had not made her sorry yet, for the girl
had obeyed her orders, although her beauty would
have brought her a score of lovers had she smiled
on their advances, but Liane had not seen any
man yet for whom she would have risked one
of granny's beatings.</p>

<p>How would it be now, when her young heart
was beating violently at the glances of a pair of
thrilling dark eyes, and the tones of a rich, musical
voice, when her face burned and her hands
trembled with exquisite ecstasy?</p>

<p>Old Boreas, why did you whisk her veil away
and show Jesse Devereaux that enchanting young
face, so rosy and dimpled, with large, shy eyes like
purple pansies, golden-hearted, with rims of jet,
so dark the arched brows and fringed lashes,
while the little head was covered with silky waves
of thick, shining chestnut hair? What would be
the outcome of this fateful meeting?</p>

<p>Sure enough, as they came in sight of Liane's
humble home, there was granny's grizzled head
peeping from the window, and, with an incoherent
good evening to her companions, Liane
darted inside the gate, hurrying into the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>But at the very threshold the old woman met
her with a snarl of rage, slapping her in the face
with a skinny, clawlike hand as she vociferated:</p>

<p>"Take that for disobeying me, girl! Walking
out with that handsome dude, after all my warnings!"</p>

<p>"Oh, granny, please don't be so cruel, striking
me for nothing! I'm too big a girl to be beaten
now!" pleaded Liane, sinking into a chair, the
crimson lines standing out vividly on her white
cheeks, while indignant tears started into her
large, pathetic eyes.</p>

<p>But her humility did not placate the cruel old
hag, who continued to glare at her victim, snarling
irascibly.</p>

<p>"Too big, eh?" she cried; "well, I'll show you,
miss, the next time I see you galivanting along the
street with a young man! Now, who is he, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Just a friend of Dolly Dorr's, granny. I&mdash;I&mdash;never
saw him till just now, when he asked Dolly
if he might share her walk."</p>

<p>"Um-hum! A frisky little piece, that Dolly
Dorr, with her yellow head and doll-baby face!
I don't want you to walk with her no more when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
he goes along, do you hear me, Liane? Two's
company, and three a crowd."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am"&mdash;wearily.</p>

<p>"Now, what have you got in that pasteboard
box, I say? If you've been buying finery, take it
back this minute. I won't pay a cent for it!"</p>

<p>"It's finery, granny, but not mine. Miss Bray
sent me to carry it to the rich young lady up at
Cliffdene, and I just stopped in to see if you will
make your own tea while I do my errand, for I
shouldn't like to come back alone after dark."</p>

<p>"Better come alone than walking with a man,
Liane Lester!" grunted the old woman, adding
more amicably: "Go along, then, and hurry back,
and I'll keep some tea warm for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, granny," the poor girl answered
dejectedly, going out with her bundle again, her
face shrouded in the blue veil, lest she should meet
some one who would notice the marks of the cruel
blow on her fair cheek.</p>

<p>Her way led along the seashore, and the brisk
breeze of September blew across the waves and
cooled her burning face, and dried the bitter tears
in her beautiful eyes, though her heart beat heavily
and slow in her breast as she thought:</p>

<p>"What a cruel life for a young girl to lead&mdash;beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and abused by an old hag whom one must
try to respect because she is old, and poor, and
is one's grandmother, though I am ashamed of the
relationship! I fear her, instead of loving her,
and it is more than likely she will kill me some
day in one of her brutal rages. Sometimes I almost
resolve to run away and find work in the
great city; but, then, she has such a horror of the
poorhouse, I have not the heart to desert her to
her fate. But I could not help being ashamed of
her when Mr. Devereaux saw her uncombed head
and angry face leering at us out of the window.
Never did I feel the misery of my condition, the
poverty of my dress and my home, so keenly as in
his presence. I do not suppose he would stoop
to marry a poor girl like me, especially with such
a dreadful relation as granny," she ended, with a
bursting sigh of pain from the bottom of her sore
heart.</p>

<p>The tide swept in almost to her feet, and the
sea's voice had a hollow tone of sympathy with
her sorrow.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish that I were dead," she cried with
a sudden passionate despair, almost wishing that
the great waves would rush in and sweep her off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
her feet and away out upon the billows, away,
from her weary, toilsome life into oblivion.</p>

<p>But here she was at the gates of beautiful Cliffdene,
the home of the Clarkes, a handsome stone
mansion set in spacious ground on a high bluff,
washed at its base by the murmuring sea.</p>

<p>She opened the gate, and went through the
beautiful grounds, gay with flowers, thinking,
what a paradise Cliffdene was and what a contrast
to the tumble-down, three-roomed shanty
she called home.</p>

<p>"How happy Miss Clarke must be; so beautiful
and rich, with fine dresses, and jewels, and scores
of handsome lovers! I wonder if Mr. Devereaux
knows her, and if he admires her like all the rest?
He would not mind marrying her, I suppose. She
does not live in a shanty, and have a spiteful old
grandmother to make her weary of her life,"
thought poor, pretty Liane, as she paused in the
setting sunlight before the broad, open door.</p>

<p>At that moment a superb figure swept down the
grand staircase toward the trembling girl&mdash;a
stately figure, gowned in rustling silk, whose rich
golden tints, softened by trimmings of creamy
lace, suited well with the handsome face, lighted
by spirited eyes of reddish brown, while the thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
waves of shining, copper-colored hair shone in the
sunset rays like a glory. Liane knew it was Miss
Clarke, the beauty and heiress; she had seen her
often riding through the streets of Stonecliff.</p>

<p>"What do you want, girl?" cried a proud,
haughty voice to Liane as they stood face to face
on the threshold, the heiress and the little working
girl.</p>

<p>"Miss Bray has sent home your silk cape, Miss
Clarke."</p>

<p>"Ah? Then bring it upstairs, and let me see
if it is all right. I have very little confidence in
these village dressmakers, though Miss Bray has
very high recommendations from the judge's
wife," cried haughty Roma Clarke, motioning the
girl to follow her upstairs, adding cruelly: "You
should have gone round to the servants' entrance,
girl. No one brings bundles to the front door."</p>

<p>Liane's cheeks flamed and her throat swelled
with resentful words that she strove to keep back,
for she knew she must not anger Miss Bray's rich
customer. But she hated her toilsome life more
than ever as she followed Roma along the richly
carpeted halls to a splendid dressing room, where
the beauty sank into a cushioned chair, haughtily
ordering the box to be opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Liane's trembling white fingers could scarcely
undo the strings, but at last she held up the exquisite
evening cape of brocaded cream silk, lined
with peach blossom and cascaded with billows
of rare lace.</p>

<p>It was daintily chic, and had been the admiration
of the workroom. All the girls had coveted
it, and Dolly Dorr had draped it over Liane's
shoulders, crying:</p>

<p>"It just suits you, you dainty princess."</p>

<p>The princess stood trembling now, for Roma
flew into a rage the instant her wonderful red-brown
eyes fell on the cape.</p>

<p>"Just as I feared! It is ruined in the arrangement
of the cascades of lace. Who did it&mdash;you?"
she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Miss Bray arranged it herself, I assure
you," faltered Liane.</p>

<p>"It must be altered at once, for I need it walking
out in the grounds with my guests to-night.
You're one of the dressmaker's girls, aren't you?
Yes? Well, you shall change it for me at once,
under my directions. Hurry and rip the lace off
carefully."</p>

<p>Liane's heart fluttered into her throat, but she
protested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I cannot stay. I should be afraid to go
home after dark. I am sure Miss Bray will alter
it to-morrow."</p>

<p>"To-morrow! when I want it to-night? You
must be crazy, girl! Do as I bid you, or I'll report
you to your employer to-morrow and have
you discharged."</p>

<p>Liane's throat choked with a frightened sob,
and she dared not disobey and risk dismissal from
Miss Bray and a beating from granny.</p>

<p>"I will do it, but I am terribly afraid to go home
alone," she faltered, taking up the scissors and
the garment.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Nothing will hurt you. Here, this
is the way I want it, and be sure you do not botch
it, or you will have to do it all over again! Now,
I am going down to dinner. I'll be back in an
hour and a half, and you ought to have it done
by that time!" cried the imperious beauty, sweeping
from the room, though Liane heard her tell
the maid in the hall to keep an eye on that girl
from the dressmaker's, that she did not slip anything
in her pocket.</p>

<p>The clever maid sidled curiously into the
lighted dressing room, and, as soon as she saw the
tears in the eyes of Liane and the crimson print<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
on her fair cheek, she jumped to her own conclusions.</p>

<p>"You poor, pretty little thing, did Miss Roma
fly in a rage and slap your face, too?" she exclaimed
compassionately.</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" the girl answered, cresting
her graceful chestnut-brown head with sudden
pride. "Do you think I would allow your mistress
to insult me so?"</p>

<p>"She would insult you whether you liked it or
not," the maid replied tartly. "She has slapped
my face several times in her tantrums since I
came here, and I would have quit right off, but
her mother is an angel, and when I complained to
her, the sweet lady gave me some handsome presents
and begged me to overlook it, because her
daughter was somewhat spoiled by being an only
child and an heiress. So I stayed for the kind
mother's sake, and if Miss Roma really did strike
you in her rage over the cape, let me tell Mrs.
Clarke, and she will reward you handsomely to
keep silence!"</p>

<p>"But I assure you Miss Clarke did not strike
me!" Liane protested.</p>

<p>"There's the print of her fingers on your face
to speak for itself, poor child!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"That mark was on my face when I came,"
Liane answered, almost inaudibly, out of her keen
humiliation.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Miss Lester&mdash;Liane Lester."</p>

<p>"A pretty-sounding name! I've heard of you
before, Miss Lester&mdash;the lovely sewing girl whose
grandmother beats her. All the village knows
it and pities you. Why do you stand it? Why
don't you run away and get married? You are
so lovely that any man might be glad to get you
for his bride."</p>

<p>The color flamed hotly into Liane's cheek. She
was proud, in spite of her poverty, and it chafed
her to have her private affairs so freely discussed
by Miss Clarke's servant.</p>

<p>"Please do not talk to me while I'm sewing,"
she said firmly, but so gently that the pert maid
did not take offense, but slipped away, returning
when the cape was nearly done, with a dainty
repast on a silver waiter.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clarke sent this with her compliments.
She heard about your being up here sewing, and
felt so sorry for you."</p>

<p>Liane had not tasted food since her meager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
midday luncheon, but she was too proud to own
that she was faint from fasting.</p>

<p>"She was very kind, but I&mdash;I really am not
hungry," she faltered.</p>

<p>"But you have not had your tea yet, and one is
apt to have a headache without it," urged the tactful
maid, and she presently persuaded Liane to
eat, although not before the cape was done, so
great was her dread of Miss Clarke's coarse
anger.</p>

<p>The maid had adroitly let Mrs. Clarke know
all about Liane, and now she slipped a crisp banknote
into her hand, whispering:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clarke sent you this for altering the cape
for her daughter."</p>

<p>Liane was almost frightened at the new rustling
five-dollar bill in her hand. She had never
seen more than three dollars at a time before&mdash;the
amount of her weekly wages from Miss Bray.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I can't take this. It's too much!
Miss Bray only gets five dollars for the making
of the whole cape," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Never mind about that, if Mrs. Clarke chooses
to pay you that for altering it, my dear miss. She
is rich and can afford to be liberal to one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
needs it. So just take what she gives you, and say
nothing&mdash;not even to her daughter, who has a
miserly heart and might scold her for her kindness,"
cautioned the maid, who pitied Liane with
all her heart.</p>

<p>Liane cried eagerly:</p>

<p>"Oh, please thank the generous lady a hundred
times for me! I love her for her kindness to a
poor orphan girl. Now, do you think Miss Roma
would come and look at the cape? For I must be
going. Granny will be angry at my coming back
so late."</p>

<p>"Here she comes now, the vixen!" and, sure
enough, a silken gown rustled over the threshold,
and Roma caught the cape up eagerly, crying:</p>

<p>"Ten to one you have botched it worse than before!
Well, really, you have followed my directions
exactly, for a wonder! That will do very
well. You may go now, and if you think you
ought to be paid anything for these few minutes'
extra work, you can collect it off Miss Bray, as
she was responsible for the alterations. Sophie,
you can show the girl out," and, throwing the
cape over her arm, the proud beauty trailed her
rustling silk over the threshold and downstairs
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"The heartless thing! I'd like to shake her!"
muttered Sophie angrily, as she led the way out
of the beautiful house down upon the moonlight
lawn, adding:</p>

<p>"I'll go to the gates with you, so you won't get
frightened at Mr. Clarke's big St. Bernard."</p>

<p>"What a beautiful night, and how sweet the
flowers smell!" murmured Liane, lifting her
heated brow to the cool night breeze, and the pitying
stars that seemed to beam on her like tender
eyes.</p>

<p>"Would you like some to take home with you?
You will be welcome, I know, for the frosts will
be getting them soon, anyhow," cried Sophie,
loading her up with a huge bunch of late autumn
roses, "and now good night, my dear young lady,"
opening the gate "you have a long walk before
you, but I hope you will get home safely."</p>

<p>Liane opened her lips to tell the woman how
frightened she was of the lonely walk home, but
she was ashamed of her cowardice, and the words
remained unsaid. With a faltering "I thank you
for your kindness; good night," she clasped the
roses to her bosom and sped away like a frightened
fawn in the moonlight, down the road along
the beach, a silent prayer in her heart that granny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
would not be angry again over her long stay, and
accuse her of "galivanting around with beaus."</p>

<p>Sophie leaned over the gate, watching her a
minute, with pity and admiration in her clear
eyes.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful creature!&mdash;a thousand times
lovelier than Miss Roma!" she thought. "But
what a cruel lot in life. It is enough to make the
very angels weep."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"MY PRETTY MAID."</p>


<p>There was not a more nervous, startled maiden
in all New England that night than Liane as she
flew along the beach, haunted by a fear of
drunken men, of whom Stonecliff had its full
quota.</p>

<p>And, indeed, she had not gone so very far before
her fears took shape.</p>

<p>She heard distinctly, above her frightened
heartbeats and her own light steps, the sound of
a man's tread gaining on her, while his voice
called out entreatingly:</p>

<p>"Elinor, Elinor! wait for me!"</p>

<p>The sea's voice, with the wind, seemed to echo
the call.</p>

<p>"Elinor, Elinor! wait for me!"</p>

<p>But Liane did not wait. She only redoubled
her speed, and she might have escaped her pursuer
but that her little foot tripped on a stone and
threw her prone upon the sands.</p>

<p>Before she could rise a man's arms closed about
her tenderly, lifting her up, while he panted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Elinor, what girlish freak is this? Why
wouldn't you wait for me, dear?"</p>

<p>Liane gasped and looked up at him in terror,
but that instant she recognized him, and her fears
all fled.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Clarke, you have made a mistake, sir.
You don't know me, although I know what your
name is. I am Liane Lester!" she cried breathlessly.</p>

<p>He dropped her hand and recoiled in surprise,
answering:</p>

<p>"I beg a hundred pardons for my apparent
rudeness. I saw you flying along as I smoked my
cigar above the hill, and your figure looked so
exactly like my wife's that I flew after you. I
hope you will find it easy to forgive me, for you
do resemble my wife very much, and, although
you are young and fair, you may take that as a
compliment, for my wife is very beautiful."</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir, and forgive you freely. I
have never seen Mrs. Clarke, but I have just come
from your house, and was running home every
step of the way because I had to stay till after
dark, and I feared my grandmother would be uneasy
over me!" faltered Liane, blushing at his intent
gaze, for the wind had blown her veil aside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and her lovely features, pure as carven pearl,
shone clearly in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"And I am detaining you yet longer! Excuse
me, and&mdash;good night," he said abruptly, smiling
kindly at her, lifting his hat and turning back
toward Cliffdene, while he thought with pleasure:</p>

<p>"What a lovely girl! She reminded me of
Elinor when she was young."</p>

<p>Liane thought kindly of him, too, as she hurried
along.</p>

<p>"What a noble face and gracious voice! Miss
Roma Clarke is blessed in having such a splendid
father."</p>

<p>She had only granny, poor child; coarse, ugly,
repulsive, cruel granny. She could not even remember
her parents or any other relation. A
lonely childhood, whose only bright memories
were of its few school days, a toilsome girlhood,
robbed of every spark of youthful pleasure;
coarse scoldings and brutal beatings. It was all
a piteous life&mdash;enough, as Sophie, the maid had
said, to make the very angels weep in pity.</p>

<p>Strange, as she hastened on, how Jesse Devereaux's
eyes and smile haunted her thoughts
with little thrills of pleasure; how she wondered
if she should ever see him again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps Dolly Dorr will make him fall in
love with her, she is so pretty, with her fluffy yellow
hair and big torquoise-blue eyes," she
thought, with a curious sensation of deadly pain,
jealous already, though she guessed it not.</p>

<p>The night was still and calm, and suddenly the
dip of oars in the water came to her ears. She
looked, and saw a little boat headed for the beach,
with a single occupant.</p>

<p>The keel grated on the shore, the man sprang
out, and came directly toward her, pausing with
hat in hand&mdash;a tall fellow, dark and bewhiskered,
with somber, dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, good evening, my pretty maid. Taking
a stroll all alone, eh? Won't you have a moonlight
row with me?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, sir; I am in a hurry to get
home. Please stand aside," for he had placed
himself in her way.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, pretty maid. It is good manners,
I trow, to answer a stranger's courteous questions,
is it not?" still barring her way. "Well,
show me the way to Cliffdene."</p>

<p>The trembling girl pointed mutely back the way
she had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;and again: Do you know Miss
Roma Clarke?"</p>

<p>"I have just seen her at Cliffdene," she answered.</p>

<p>"So she is not married yet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Liane answered, trying to pass, but
he caught her hand, exclaiming mockingly:</p>

<p>"Not married yet? Well, that is very good
news to me. I will give you a kiss, pretty one, for
that information."</p>

<p>"You shall not! Release me at once, you
hound!" cried the girl, struggling to free herself.</p>

<p>But the insolent stranger only clasped her
closer and drew her to him, the fumes of his liquor-laden
breath floating over her pure brow as
he struggled to kiss her shrieking lips.</p>

<p>And, absorbed in the conflict, neither one noticed
a third person coming toward them from
the town&mdash;an exceedingly handsome young man,
who hurried his steps in time to comprehend the
meaning of the scene before him, and then shot
out an athletic arm, and promptly bowled the
wretch over upon the wet sands.</p>

<p>"Lie there, you cur, till I give you leave to
rise!" he thundered, planting his foot on the fellow's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
chest while he turned toward the young
lady.</p>

<p>"Why, good heavens! Is it you, Miss Lester?"
he cried, in wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Devereaux. I was hurrying home
from an errand to Cliffdene when this man
jumped out of his boat, and threatened to kiss
me."</p>

<p>"Apologize to the lady on your knees, cur!"
cried Jesse Devereaux, helping him with a hand
on his coat collar.</p>

<p>The wretch obeyed in craven fear.</p>

<p>"Now tell me where you came from in the
boat."</p>

<p>"From the nearest town," sullenly.</p>

<p>"Then get into that boat and go back to it as
fast as you can row, and if you are ever caught
in Stonecliff again, I promise to thrash you within
an inch of your life."</p>

<p>The defeated bully obeyed in craven silence,
but the gleam of his somber eyes boded no good
to the man who had so coolly mastered him.</p>

<p>Devereaux and Liane stood side by side, watching
the little boat shoot away over the dancing billows,
leaving ripples of phosphorescent light in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the wake of the oars. Then he turned and took
her hand.</p>

<p>"You had quite an adventure," he said. "Why,
you are trembling like a leaf, poor child!"</p>

<p>He felt like drawing her to his breast, and
soothing her fears; but that would not be conventional.
So he could only regard her with the
tenderest pity and admiration, while clasping the
trembling little hand as tight as he dared.</p>

<p>Liane was so nervous she could not speak at
first, and he continued gently:</p>

<p>"It was rather imprudent for a young girl like
you to be walking out alone after nightfall. Did
you not know it, Miss Lester?"</p>

<p>She faltered nervously:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I knew it! I was frightened almost
to death, but I&mdash;I could not help it!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"My employer sent me on an errand to Cliffdene,
and I was detained there until after dark."</p>

<p>"They should have sent some one to see you
safely home."</p>

<p>"Yes," Liane answered, shivering, but not making
any explanation. She hated in her simple,
girlish pride to have him know how she had been
treated by Roma Clarke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I must be going now. Thank you ever so
much for coming to my rescue," she added, stooping
to gather her roses, that lay scattered on the
sands.</p>

<p>Jesse Devereaux helped her, and kept them,
saying as he drew her little hand closely within
his arm:</p>

<p>"I will carry them and see you safe home."</p>

<p>Arm in arm they paced along under the brilliant
moonlight, with the solemn voice of the
ocean in their ears. But they were heedless. They
heard only the beating of their own excited hearts.</p>

<p>The mere presence of this man, whom she had
never met till to-day, filled Liane's innocent heart
with ecstasy.</p>

<p>To be near him like this, with her arm linked in
his so close that she felt the quick throbbing of
his disturbed heart; to meet the glances of his
passionate, dark eyes, to hear the murmuring
tones of his musical voice as he talked to her so
kindly&mdash;oh, it was bliss such as she had never
enjoyed before, but that she could have wished
might go on now forever!</p>

<p>He made her tell him all that the stranger had
said to her, and Liane felt him give a quick start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
when Roma's name was mentioned, although he
said lightly:</p>

<p>"He must be some discarded lover of Miss
Clarke."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, and, raising her eyes, she
saw near at hand the wretched shanty she called
her home.</p>

<p>How short their walk had been&mdash;barely a minute
it seemed to the girl! But now they must
part.</p>

<p>She essayed to draw her hand from his clasping
arm, murmuring:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I cannot let you go any farther with me,
please! Granny does not allow me to walk out
with&mdash;with gentlemen! She told me to come
home alone!"</p>

<p>Jesse Devereaux protested laughingly, but he
soon saw that Liane was in terrible earnest, her
face pale, her great eyes dilated with fear, her
slender form shaking as with a chill.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you cannot have the
privilege of receiving me sometimes as a visitor
under your own roof?" he asked, more seriously
then; but the girl suddenly uttered a low moan of
alarm, and shrank from him, turning her eyes
wildly upon an approaching grotesque form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Granny had worked herself into a fury over
Liane's long stay, and at last hobbled forth to
meet her, armed with a very stout cane, that
would serve the double purpose of a walking stick
and an instrument of punishment.</p>

<p>And, in spite of her age, she was strong and
agile, and Liane would have cause to rue the hour
she was born when next they met.</p>

<p>She strained her malevolent gaze all around
for a sight of the truant, and when they lighted
on Liane and Devereaux, arm in arm, a growl of
fury issued from her lips.</p>

<p>Before Liane could escape, she darted forward
with surprising agility, and lifted her stout cane
over the girl's shrinking head.</p>

<p>A start, a shriek, and Devereaux saw, as suddenly
as if the old hag had arisen from the earth
by his side, the peril that menaced Liane.</p>

<p>That descending blow was enough to kill the
frail, lovely girl, the object of granny's brutal
spite!</p>

<p>Another instant and the stick would descend
on the beautiful head!</p>

<p>But Devereaux's upraised arm received the
force of the blow, and that arm fell shattered and
helpless by his side, but the other hand violently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
wrenched the old woman away from her victim,
as he demanded:</p>

<p>"You vile beast! What is the meaning of this
murderous assault?"</p>

<p>They glared at each other, and the old woman
snarled:</p>

<p>"I have a right to beat her! She disobeyed my
orders, and she belongs to me. She's my granddaughter."</p>

<p>"Heaven help me, it is true!" moaned Liane, as
he looked at her for confirmation.</p>

<p>"Let me get at her! Let me get at her!"
shrieked granny, intent on punishing the girl, and
writhing in Devereaux's clutch.</p>

<p>But Devereaux, with one arm hanging helpless
at his side, held her firmly with the other.</p>

<p>"You shall not touch her!" he said sternly.
"You shall go to prison for this outrage."</p>

<p>At that both the old woman and the girl uttered
a cry of remonstrance.</p>

<p>Devereaux looked at Liane inquiringly, and
she faltered:</p>

<p>"The disgrace would fall on me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, she is my granddaughter," howled
granny eagerly, seeing her advantage. Devereaux
comprehended, too. He groaned:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what can you do? You must not be exposed
again to her fury!"</p>

<p>Granny glared malevolently, while Liane bent
her eyes to the ground, meditating a moment ere
she looked up, and said timidly:</p>

<p>"I think you are right. I cannot live with
granny any more, for she would surely kill me
some day. Let her go home, and I will go and
spend the night with Dolly Dorr, who lives not
far from here."</p>

<p>"You hear what Miss Lester says? Will you
go home peaceably, while she goes to her friend
for safety?" demanded Devereaux, eager to close
the scene, for he was faint from the pain of his
broken arm.</p>

<p>Granny saw that she was cornered, and cunningly
began to feign repentance, whimpering
that she was sorry, and would never do so any
more if Liane would only come home with her
now, for she was afraid to spend the night alone.</p>

<p>"She shall not go with you, you treacherous
cat," he answered sternly, releasing her and bidding
her angrily to return home at once.</p>

<p>Cowed by his authority, she could not but
choose to obey, but as she started, she flung back
one shaft:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Better come with me, Liane, than stay with
him, my dear. Remember my warnings about
rich young men and pretty, poor girls! A beating
is safer than his love!"</p>

<p>Liane's cheeks flamed at the coarse thrust, but
Devereaux said earnestly:</p>

<p>"Do not mind her taunt, Miss Lester. I will
always be a true friend to you, believe me!"</p>

<p>"You are a true friend already. From what
horrors have you saved me to-night?" Liane
cried, bursting into tears. "Your poor arm, how
helpless it hangs! Oh, I fear it has been broken
in my defense," and suddenly sinking on her
knees, in an excess of tenderest gratitude, she
pressed her warm, rosy lips to the hand that had
so bravely defended her from insult and injury.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are a hero, you have saved my life,
and I can never forget you!" she sobbed hysterically.</p>

<p>"Yes, my arm is broken; I must hurry back to
town and have it set," he answered faintly. "I
must let you go on to Miss Dorr's alone, but it
is not far, and you are safe now. Good night,"
he murmured, leaving her abruptly in his pain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SECRET LOVE.</p>


<p>Liane gazed after Devereaux's retreating form
in bewilderment, her cheeks burning with the
thought:</p>

<p>"He was angry because I kissed his hand! Oh,
why was I so bold? I did not mean to be, but it
made my heart ache to see him suffering so cruelly
from his defense of my life! How pale he looked&mdash;almost
as if he were going to faint. Oh, I love
him!" and she wept despairingly, as she hurried
to Dolly Dorr's, careless now of the beautiful
roses that lay crushed upon the ground where
they had fallen.</p>

<p>Dolly was sitting on her little vine-wreathed
porch, singing a pretty love song, and she started
in surprise as Liane came up the steps.</p>

<p>"Why, Liane, my dear, what is the matter?
You are crying; your cheeks are all wet!" she
cried, putting her arms about the forlorn girl,
who sobbed:</p>

<p>"May I stay with you all night, Dolly? Granny
has beaten me again, and I have run away!"</p>

<p>"I don't blame you! You should have done it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
long ago. Of course you may stay with me as
long as you wish!" replied pretty little Dolly, with
ready sympathy, that might not have been so
warm if she had known all that had transpired
between Liane and Devereaux, on whom she had
set her vain little heart.</p>

<p>But Liane was too shy and nervous to tell her
friend the whole story. She simply explained,
when pressed, that granny had beaten her for
walking with Devereaux that afternoon, and attempted
it again because she was late getting
home, after altering Miss Clarke's cape.</p>

<p>"So I ran away to you," she added wearily.</p>

<p>"That was right. We will all make you welcome,"
said Dolly cordially, sure that her father
and mother, and her two little brothers, would all
make good her promise.</p>

<p>"You should have seen them all peeping out of
the window in amazement this afternoon when I
came walking up with the grand Devereaux at
my side," she continued consciously. "I asked
him in, and he sat on the porch nearly half an
hour talking to me. When he was leaving, I
asked him to call again, and pinned some pansies
in his buttonhole, and what do you think he said,
Liane?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"I could never guess," the girl answered, with
a secret pang of the keenest jealousy.</p>

<p>"He said: 'What exquisite pansies! They remind
me of Miss Lester's eyes&mdash;such a rare, purplish
blue, with dark shadings."</p>

<p>Liane caught her breath with stifled rapture,
that he had remembered her, but Dolly added
wistfully:</p>

<p>"He must have read in my face that I was disappointed
at not having a compliment, too, for he
went on to say that my eyes were just like bluebells.
Liane, which are the prettier flowers, pansies
or bluebells?"</p>

<p>"I should say that it is all a matter of taste,"
Liane replied gently.</p>

<p>So presently they went upstairs to bed, but
Dolly was so excited she talked half the night.</p>

<p>"Liane, have you heard of the Beauty Show
that is to be held in the town hall next week?" she
asked, as she rolled her yellow locks in kid curlers
to make them fluffy.</p>

<p>Liane shook her head.</p>

<p>"No? Why, that is strange. Every one is talking
about it, and they say that you and I are pretty
enough to compete for the prize, although Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Roma Clarke intends to exhibit her handsomest
portrait."</p>

<p>"Is it a portrait show?"</p>

<p>"It is this way, Liane: A Boston artist has a
commission to design the outside cover of a magazine
for December, and he wants to get a lovely
young girl for the central figure&mdash;a young girl
taken from life. So he has advertised for five
hundred pictures of beauties, to be delivered by
next week, when they will be exhibited on the
walls of the town hall, and judges appointed to decide
on the fairest. Of course, the artist himself
is to be one of the judges, and they say that Mr.
Clarke and Mr. Devereaux will be two of the others,
but I don't know the rest. Don't you think
it's unfair, Liane, to have Roma Clarke's father
and lover for judges? Of course, they will show
her some partiality in their votes."</p>

<p>Liane murmured with dry lips in a choking
voice:</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Devereaux Miss Clarke's lover?"</p>

<p>"So they say, but I hope it's not true. I'm trying
to catch him myself," confessed Dolly quite
frankly. "I don't really think it's fair for Miss
Clarke to compete for the prize, anyway. She
ought to leave the chance to some beautiful, poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
girl that needs that hundred dollars so much
worse than she does!"</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars!" exclaimed Liane.</p>

<p>"Yes; just think of it! You must try for the
prize, Liane."</p>

<p>"I don't know; I must think over it first.
Wouldn't it seem conceited in me? As if I were
sure that I was a raging beauty?" doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Why, so you are! Every one says so, and you
can see it for yourself in the glass there! Prettier
than I am, really!" Dolly owned magnanimously.</p>

<p>"Small good my pretty face has brought me!"
sighed Liane.</p>

<p>"Well, it may get you that hundred dollars, if
you try for it! And it might have gotten you a
nice husband long ago, but for your cantankerous
old granny! The idea of her slapping you
for walking with that splendid Devereaux! But
I'll give him a hint, when I see him again, never
to go near you any more!" exclaimed Dolly, quite
eager to give the warning, for she thought:</p>

<p>"I didn't like the way he talked about her eyes;
for she had certainly made an impression on him,
and I'm afraid I shouldn't stand much chance if
she went in to win against me. So I'm glad of
granny's opposition for once! If I'm lucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
enough to marry him, I'll have Liane at my house
for a long visit, and introduce her to some good
catches."</p>

<p>Liane little dreamed of these shrewd thoughts
in the pretty, little, yellow noddle, while Dolly
prattled on:</p>

<p>"You have not seen the artist, either, have you?
His name is Malcolm Dean, and he's quite a handsome
fellow. I wish one of us could catch him,
Liane! Why, I've heard he gets a fortune for
everything he designs, and that magazine has
promised him a fortune for their December
cover."</p>

<p>"We had better go to sleep, Dolly, or we will
be too tired to go to work in the morning," suggested
Liane, and Dolly obediently shut her eyes
and drifted off into dreamland.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ROMA'S LOVERS.</p>


<p>Haughty Roma Clarke did not give another
thought to the poor sewing girl who had pleased
her fastidious taste so entirely in the alteration
of her cape.</p>

<p>She threw the dainty wrap over her graceful
shoulders, for the September evenings already
grew chill, and wandered out into the grounds to
watch for Jesse Devereaux, whom she expected
to call.</p>

<p>Her restless, impatient nature would not permit
her to wait patiently in the drawing room to
receive him. She thought it would be so gloriously
romantic to stroll about the grounds, clinging
to his arm, the splendid moonlight etherealizing
her beauty, the murmur of the sea in their
ears, the fragrance of flowers all around them.
She would not be bothered here with papa or
mamma coming into the room to talk to Jesse, and
breaking up their delightful tte--tte.</p>

<p>She went into a rose arbor near the gate, thinking
that she would go out to meet him as soon
as she heard the click of the latch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>She had been there but a few moments when
Liane passed by with the maid, but she kept very
still, though she thought:</p>

<p>"That girl is actually beautiful, and would look
superb in good clothes instead of that simple,
dark-blue print gown. How foolish it seems for
poor girls to be pretty, when they can have nothing
nice to set off their beauty. I suppose they
must always be pining for riches. How that poor
serving girl must have envied me while sewing
on this cape! Well, I suppose Miss Bray will give
her perhaps twenty-five cents for the extra work,
and that will buy her a new ribbon. She ought
to be glad that I made her alter it, giving her a
little extra pay from her employer. Of course,
she could not expect me to pay her myself. My
allowance from papa is much too small to permit
me the luxury of charity!"</p>

<p>She heard Sophie's light tread, as she returned
to the house and muttered:</p>

<p>"I hate that maid. I know she tells tales of
me to mamma, and that mamma believes everything,
instead of scolding her for tattling! Never
mind, Miss Sophie; see if I don't pay you off some
time for your meddling! And as for giving you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
those old gowns you've been hinting for so long,
I'd stick them into the fire first!"</p>

<p>She gathered a rose, pulled it to pieces viciously,
as if it had been the pert maid she was demolishing,
then sighed impatiently:</p>

<p>"Heigh-ho, how slow he is coming!"</p>

<p>The gate latch clicked, and she sprang up with
a start, her eyes flashing, her heart throbbing
with joy.</p>

<p>She looked out, and saw the figure of a man
coming along the graveled walk.</p>

<p>As he came opposite she started forward, crying
sweetly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Jesse, dear, is that you?"</p>

<p>The man stopped and faced her. It was her
father, and he laughed merrily:</p>

<p>"Not Jesse, dear; but papa, dear!"</p>

<p>Roma recoiled in bitter disappointment, and
said petulantly:</p>

<p>"Jesse promised to come. Have you seen
him?"</p>

<p>"No, I only walked outside the gates a little
way. I saw no one except a very lovely young
girl coming from here. Do you know anything
about her, Roma?"</p>

<p>"If she was dressed like a kitchen maid in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
print gown, she was a girl from the dressmaker's
who brought home some work," Roma answered
carelessly.</p>

<p>"I did not notice her dress in the moonlight. I
could not keep my eyes from her face, she was
so very beautiful," Mr. Clarke replied, somewhat
dreamily.</p>

<p>Roma shrugged her shoulders scornfully:</p>

<p>"A poor girl has no business to be pretty,"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke frowned at the sentiment.</p>

<p>"Roma, I do not like to hear you express yourself
so heartlessly. You would like to be pretty
even if you were poor."</p>

<p>"I cannot even imagine myself poor like the
common herd!" she retorted, tossing her beautiful
head with queenly pride.</p>

<p>If she had been looking at the man before her,
she must have seen that a strange look came upon
his face as his secret thoughts ran sarcastically:</p>

<p>"Ignorance indeed is bliss, in this case."</p>

<p>But he knew he could never tell her the truth,
much as he sometimes longed to do it, in a sudden
anger at her ignoble nature. He could not love
the girl who had been taken from a foundling
asylum, and placed in the stead of his own lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
darling. Ah, no, it was impossible! It seemed to
him that there was nothing lovable about Roma,
although his wife clung to her with devotion.</p>

<p>He looked at her as she faced him in the moonlight,
so proud and confident of her position; her
jewels gleaming, her silks rustling as she moved,
and thought that, but for the chance that had
brought her into his home, she, too, might now
be dressed like a servant as she had so contemptuously
said of poor Liane Lester.</p>

<p>He felt as if he should like to cast it into her
face, the willful, insolent beauty, but he clinched
his teeth over the bitter words.</p>

<p>"Heaven help me to bear my cross for Elinor's
sake!" he thought.</p>

<p>Roma suddenly came closer to him, and placed
her hand on his arm, saying coaxingly:</p>

<p>"Please don't be angry, papa, dear! I didn't
mean to seem heartless!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that, Roma, for your heart should
be full of sympathy, instead of contempt, for that
poor, pretty, little sewing girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa," gently answered Roma, for she
intended to ask him for some new jewels to-morrow,
and did not wish to vex him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me," he continued eagerly, "all that you
know about this pretty Miss Lester."</p>

<p>"I know nothing, papa. I never saw her before
this evening, when she brought home my work,
and said she was one of Miss Bray's sewing girls.
Why, what an interest you take in her, papa! Did
you stop and speak to the poor girl?"</p>

<p>"She was running to get home in a hurry, and
tripped and fell down; I assisted her to rise. We
introduced ourselves, and then she went on; that
was all," he explained. "Well, I will leave you
to watch for Jesse, while I go and talk to your
mamma."</p>

<p>Beautiful Roma looked after Mr. Clarke with
angry eyes, muttering:</p>

<p>"The idea of scolding me, his daughter and
heiress, about that insignificant little sewing girl!
And he thought her very beautiful. I wonder if
mamma would be jealous if she heard of his open
admiration! I think I will give her a hint, and
see!" and she laughed wickedly, while she again
turned her eyes toward the gate, watching for her
laggard lover.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he come?" she murmured impatiently,
for Roma was so spoiled by overindulgence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of a willful nature that she could not bear to
wait for anything. She was imperious as a queen.</p>

<p>As the minutes slipped past without bringing
the lover, for whom she waited so eagerly, her
angry temper began to flame in her great, red-brown
eyes like sparks of fire, and she paced back
and forth between the arbor and the gate like a
caged lioness, her bosom heaving with emotion.</p>

<p>Jesse Devereaux, who had known her only as a
bright, vivacious girl, would not have known his
sweetheart now, in her fury of rage at his nonappearance.</p>

<p>Angry tears sparkled in her eyes, as she cried:</p>

<p>"If he could not keep his word, he should have
sent an excuse. He must know I shall be bitterly
disappointed!"</p>

<p>All the beauty of the night mattered nothing
to her now. The moonlight, the flowers, the murmur
of the sea, were maddening to the girl waiting
there alone for her recreant lover. Love and
hate struggled for mastery in her capricious
breast.</p>

<p>Jesse Devereaux had been hard to win, but she
prized him all the more for that, and she could
not bear the least apparent slight from him.</p>

<p>"He did not care to come; he has let some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
trivial excuse keep him away! I will have to
teach him that he cannot trifle with my love!" she
vowed darkly, flying into the house in a passion.</p>

<p>Seating herself angrily at her desk, she wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Devereaux</span>: Your failure to keep your engagement
with me this evening, without any apparent excuse,
seems to me a sufficient excuse for breaking our engagement.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Roma.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>She tore a sparkling diamond from her finger,
wrapped it in a bit of tissue paper, and inclosed
it in the letter, hurrying downstairs again and
sending it off to Stonecliff by a messenger, with
special directions to deliver it personally to Jesse
Devereaux at his hotel.</p>

<p>Her feelings somewhat relieved by this explosion
of resentment, Roma laughed harshly, murmuring
to herself:</p>

<p>"He will be here the first thing in the morning
to beg me to take him back, promising never to
slight me so cruelly again. Of course, I will forgive
him, after pouting a while, and making him
very uneasy, but from this day forward he will
have learned a lesson that I must be first with him
in everything. I will never tolerate neglect, and
he must learn that fact at once."</p>

<p>She was so agitated she could not go into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
house just yet. She wandered about the grounds,
trying to overcome her angry excitement before
she went in, for she knew that her mother was
sure to come to her room for a little chat before
retiring, and she could not bear her questioning.</p>

<p>"Dear mamma, I know she idolizes me, but at
times I find her very tiresome," she soliloquized.
"How tired I get of her lecturing on the beauty
of goodness, as if I were the wickedest girl in the
world! I know I am not goody-goody, as she is,
and I don't want to be! Good people don't have
much fun in this world; they let the wicked ones
get the advantage and run over them always.
However, I shall be as sweet as sugar to her to-night,
for I want her to help me tease papa to-morrow
for that set of rubies I want!"</p>

<p>She leaned upon the gate, letting the cool wind
caress her heated brow, waiting for her cheeks
to cool, and her heart to thump less fiercely with
anger before she went in to encounter her
mother's searching gaze; but it would have been a
thousand times better for her if she had gone to
sob her grief out on that mother's gentle breast,
than waited here for the fate that was swiftly approaching.</p>

<p>The dark, sinister-looking stranger who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
insulted Liane Lester on the beach had rowed
back to shore as soon as Devereaux was out of
sight.</p>

<p>He was interested in Roma Clarke, as his questions
to Liane had plainly shown.</p>

<p>He came slowly, cautiously, up to the gate, his
heart leaping with hope as he saw a beautiful
head leaning over it that he hoped and believed
must be Roma's herself.</p>

<p>"What luck for me, and what a shock for her!"
he muttered grimly, as he advanced.</p>

<p>At the same moment Mrs. Clarke was sending
Roma's maid out with a message that it was so
chilly she ought to come in, or she might take cold.</p>

<p>She would not listen to her husband's remonstrance
that Roma was with her lover, and might
not wish to be interrupted.</p>

<p>"Jesse can come in, too; I am sure he would
not wish Roma to get sick out in the night air with
nothing on her head!" cried the anxious mother.</p>

<p>"How you love that girl!" he cried testily, and
she laughed sweetly.</p>

<p>"Are you getting jealous of my love for our
daughter, dear? You need not, for the first place
in my heart is yours, but remember how devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
I have always been to Roma, ever since she was
born."</p>

<p>"I know, but has she ever seemed to show the
right appreciation of your devotion?" he exclaimed
abruptly.</p>

<p>A deep and bitter sigh quivered over the wife's
lips, but she parried the question with a complaint:</p>

<p>"You are always insinuating some fault against
my darling. Your heart is cold to her, Edmund."</p>

<p>He put his arms around her, and kissed the still
lovely face with the passion of a lover.</p>

<p>"At least it is not cold to you, my darling!" he
cried; and pleased at his love-making, she momentarily
forgot Roma, and nestled confidingly
against his breast.</p>

<p>He was glad that she could not know his secret
thoughts, for they ran stubbornly:</p>

<p>"She is right. My heart is indeed cold to
Roma. I shall be glad when Devereaux marries
her and takes her away, and I do not believe it will
break my wife's heart, either; for she seemed to
bear it well enough when her daughter was away
at boarding school those three years."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Sophie went away most reluctantly
with her message, thinking:</p>

<p>"I am sure Miss Roma will not thank me for
breaking up her tte--tte with her lover, for, of
course, she is staying out just to keep him all to
herself. But I cannot disobey Mrs. Clarke's commands,
though I'll saunter along as slowly as I
can, so as to give Miss Roma a little more time."</p>

<p>Sophie was an intelligent and good-hearted girl,
and might have been invaluable to Roma, if she
could have appreciated such a treasure; but by
her selfishness and arrogance she had completely
antagonized the young woman, who only stayed,
as she had frankly told Liane, for Mrs. Clarke's
sake.</p>

<p>As she strolled along, picking a flower here and
there, and giving Roma all the time she could, she
thought of Liane with pity and admiration.</p>

<p>"There's a lovely girl for you! If she had been
rich instead of Miss Roma, I fancy she'd make a
better mistress," she murmured, and then the
sound of subdued voices came to her ears.</p>

<p>"There she is at the gate with Mr. Devereaux,
sure!" she thought, as she saw two heads together,
the man's outside, while the murmur of
excited voices came to her ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope they aren't quarreling already! She
had trouble enough hooking him, to be sure!" she
thought as she went forward noiselessly, perhaps
hoping to catch a word.</p>

<p>She was rewarded by hearing Roma say:</p>

<p>"I will come outside and talk with you. We
must not run the risk of being overheard by any
one from the house."</p>

<p>The gate latch clicked as she stepped outside
and joined her companion, a tall, dark man, whom
Sophie did not doubt must be Jesse Devereaux.</p>

<p>She led her companion out toward the high
cliff, washed at its base by the surging sea, and
Sophie stole after them, thinking curiously:</p>

<p>"Now, what secret have they got, these two,
that no one from the house must overhear, I
wonder? It is very strange, indeed, and I'll bet
they have a mind to elope, just to make a sensation!
These rich folks will do any foolish thing
to get their names and pictures in the papers!
They think it's fame, but any jailbird can get published
in the papers. Well, I'll follow you, my
lady, and there's one from the house who will hear
your secret in spite of your precautions."</p>

<p>She crept along after them, so near that if they
had turned their heads they must have seen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
skulking figure; but neither Roma nor the man
looked back, but kept along the edge of the cliff
on the narrow path, talking angrily, it seemed to
Sophie, though their words were drowned by the
roar of the sea, to the great chagrin of the curious
maid.</p>

<p>"But they are certainly quarreling! Ah, now
they are stopping! I don't want to interrupt them
yet; so I'll hide!" she thought, darting behind a
convenient ledge.</p>

<p>In the clear and brilliant moonlight the two
figures faced each other, perilously near to the
edge of the cliff, and Sophie, peering at them from
her concealment, suddenly saw a terrible thing
happen.</p>

<p>The man had his back to the sea, facing Roma,
and both were talking vehemently, it seemed,
from their gestures; when all at once the girl
thrust out her foot and struck her companion's
knee, causing him to lose his balance. The result
was inevitable.</p>

<p>The tall figure lurched backward, swayed an
instant, trying to recover itself, toppled over with
a shriek of rage, and went over the cliff a hundred
feet down into the foaming waters.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AFTER THE CRIME.</p>


<p>Sophie Nutter could hardly believe the evidence
of her own startled eyes when she saw the terrible
crime of her young mistress.</p>

<p>She knew that Roma was selfish and cruel, but
she had never realized that such depths of wickedness
were concealed beneath her beautiful exterior.</p>

<p>When she saw Roma push the supposed Jesse
Devereaux over the face of the cliff to a dreadful
death, the hair seemed to rise on her head with
horror, and from her lips burst an uncontrollable
shriek of dismay and remonstrance, while she
tried to spring forward with outstretched arms in
a futile impulse to avert the man's awful fate.</p>

<p>Too late! The writhing, struggling body went
hurtling down over the high cliff, and struck the
water with a loud thud that dashed the spray high
in air. Then Sophie's limbs relaxed beneath her,
and she fell in a heap like one paralyzed, behind
the ledge of stones, while her terrified shriek went
wandering forth on the air of night like a wailing
banshee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>But Roma had shrieked, wildly, too&mdash;perhaps
in nature's recoil from her own sin&mdash;so Sophie's
protesting cry lost itself in dismal echoes. Then
all grew still save for the voice of the sea and the
dash of water churning itself to fury at the foot
of the bluff.</p>

<p>The maid, crouching low in her concealment,
heard Roma flying with terror-haunted footsteps
from the scene of her awful crime, and muttered
distractedly:</p>

<p>"She has murdered her handsome lover, the
beautiful fiend! God in heaven alone knows why!
I thought she loved the very ground he trod on!"</p>

<p>The maid was suffering from severe nervous
shock. She sobbed hysterically as she thought
of handsome Jesse Devereaux lying drowned at
the foot of the cliff, and beaten by the cruel waves
that would wash him out to sea when the tide
turned, so that Roma's sin would be forever hidden
from the sight of men.</p>

<p>"I will go and inform on her at once! She shall
suffer the penalty!" she vowed at first; but when
she thought of gentle, loving Mrs. Clarke her resolution
wavered.</p>

<p>"It will kill her to learn of her child's wickedness,
the good, gentle lady who has been so kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and generous to me! I do not know what to do!
I would like to punish the daughter, and spare
the mother, but I cannot do both," she groaned,
in a state of miserable indecision.</p>

<p>It was some time before her trembling limbs
permitted her to drag herself from the spot; and
when she gained the house and her bed she could
not rest. She tossed and groaned, and at length
was seized with hysterical spasms, obliging the
housemaid to call for assistance.</p>

<p>In the meantime Roma, far less excited than
Sophie, had also retired to her room and flung
herself down by the open window to await impatiently
the inevitable good-night chat with her
mother.</p>

<p>"I wish she would not come. Her affection
grows really tiresome at times," she muttered rebelliously,
as she heard the light footsteps outside
her door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke entered and sat down close to her
daughter, putting her white hand tenderly on the
girl's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Good girl, to come in when mamma sent for
you," she said caressingly, as to a child.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;sent&mdash;for&mdash;me!" Roma faltered, in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, by Sophie. I feared you would take cold,
bareheaded out in the night air."</p>

<p>"I have not seen Sophie," Roma muttered sullenly,
with a downcast face.</p>

<p>"Why did Jesse leave so soon?" continued the
mother curiously.</p>

<p>"He did not come. I have been walking in the
grounds alone."</p>

<p>"But your papa said, dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; papa told you I was waiting for
Jesse at the gate, but he never came. He disappointed
me!"</p>

<p>"Why, that is very strange, dear. And you are
grieved over it, I see. Your face is pale, and your
whole frame trembles under my touch. Do not
take it so hard, darling. Of course Jesse was detained.
He will come to-morrow."</p>

<p>"He should have sent me an excuse, mamma!"</p>

<p>"He must have been prevented. I am sure he
would not neglect you purposely. He will explain
to-morrow."</p>

<p>Roma tossed her proud head, with a bitter
laugh.</p>

<p>"I tell you, mamma, I will not brook such negligence.
I have broken our engagement."</p>

<p>"Roma!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl gave a reckless laugh of wounded
pride.</p>

<p>"Yes; I sent him a note, with his ring, just
now, setting him free."</p>

<p>"You were precipitate, Roma; you should have
waited for an explanation."</p>

<p>"I did not choose to wait!"</p>

<p>"I fear you will regret it."</p>

<p>"I do not think it likely."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke gazed at her in sorrowful silence,
whose reproach goaded Roma into adding
haughtily:</p>

<p>"I wished to teach Jesse, early, a lesson that I
am not to be neglected for anything; that I must
be foremost always in his thoughts."</p>

<p>"But have you not gone too far in giving him
this lesson? His thoughts will not belong to you
now."</p>

<p>"He will bring back his ring, and beg me to
take it back to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Are you certain, Roma?"</p>

<p>"As sure as I am of my life!" with a confident
laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you know him better than I do,
Roma, but I fancied Jesse Devereaux very high-spirited&mdash;too
high-spirited to bear dictation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"He will have to bend to my will!" Roma cried
arrogantly, and the gentle lady sighed, for she
knew that her daughter made this her own motto
in life. Power and dominion were hers by the
force of "might makes right."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke rose with a sigh and touched
Roma's cheeks with her lips, saying kindly:</p>

<p>"Well, I hope it will all come right, dear. Good
night."</p>

<p>She returned to her own room, thinking:
"Poor girl, she is the miserable victim of her own
caprice. I could see that she is too terribly agitated
to sleep an hour to-night."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">GRANNY'S REVENGE.</p>


<p>The half dozen pretty young girls who served
for Miss Bray were light-hearted, hopeful young
creatures in spite of their poverty, and at their
daily work they sociably discussed their personal
affairs with the freedom and intimacy of friends.
Beaus and dress were the choice topics just as in
higher circles of society. Liane Lester was the
only quiet one among them, granny's edicts barring
her both from lovers and finery.</p>

<p>Dolly Dorr was turning them all green with
envy the next morning by boasting of the attentions
she had received from the grand Mr. Devereaux,
when one of the girls, Lottie Day, interposed:</p>

<p>"He is not likely to call on you again very soon,
for I heard Brother Tom saying at breakfast this
morning that Mr. Devereaux had broken his arm
by a fall last night."</p>

<p>A chorus of compassionate remarks followed
this announcement, and Dolly exclaimed vivaciously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I might be allowed to nurse the poor
fellow!"</p>

<p>Nan Brooks replied chaffingly:</p>

<p>"Miss Roma Clarke might have some objection
to that scheme. They say she is engaged to him."</p>

<p>"That's why I want a good chance to cut her
out. The proud, stuck-up thing!" cried Dolly indignantly,
and from the remarks that followed it
was plainly to be seen that Miss Clarke was not a
favorite among the pretty sewing girls.</p>

<p>Roma had never lost an opportunity to impress
them with the difference in their stations and her
own, as if she were made of quite a superior sort
of clay, and the high-spirited young creatures bitterly
resented her false pride.</p>

<p>Not one of them but would have been glad to
see Dolly "cut her out," as they phrased it, with
the handsome Devereaux, but they frankly believed
that there could be no such luck.</p>

<p>In their gay chatter, Liane alone remained silent,
her beautiful head bent low over her sewing
to hide the tears that had sprung to her eyes while
they talked of Jesse Devereaux's accident.</p>

<p>"It was for my sake!" she thought gratefully,
with rising blushes, though her heart sank like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
lead when she heard them saying he was engaged
to Miss Clarke.</p>

<p>"He belongs to that proud, cruel girl! How I
pity him!" she thought. "Yet, no doubt, he admires
her very much. She does not show him the
mean, selfish side of her character, as she does to
us poor sewing girls."</p>

<p>She would have given anything if only she had
not yielded to her passionate gratitude, and kissed
his hand.</p>

<p>"He was disgusted at my boldness. He believed
I had given him my love unasked, and he
turned away in scorn. Yet how could I help it,
he was so kind to me; first saving me from that
ruffian, then from granny's blows? Oh, how could
I help but love him? And I wish, like Dolly, that
I might be permitted to nurse him as some reparation
for his goodness," she thought, her cheeks
burning and her heart throbbing wildly with the
tenderness she could not stifle.</p>

<p>Every way she looked it seemed to her she
could see his dark face, with its dazzling black
eyes, looking at her with an admiration and tenderness
they should not have shown, if he were
indeed betrothed to another. Those glances and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
smiles had lured Liane's heart from her own keeping
and doomed her to passionate unrest.</p>

<p>She listened to everything in silence, nursing
her sweet, painful secret in her heart, afraid lest
a breath should betray her, until suddenly Ethel
Barry, the girl next her, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"How quiet Liane is this morning, not taking
the least interest in anything we say!"</p>

<p>"No interest! Oh, Heaven!" thought Liane,
but Dolly Dorr interposed:</p>

<p>"You would be quiet, too, if you had been
beaten as Liane was by granny last night, and
forced to seek refuge with a friend."</p>

<p>Liane crimsoned painfully at having her own
troubles discussed, but granny's faults were public
property, and she could not deny the truth.</p>

<p>"She is old and cross," she said, generously
trying to offer some excuse.</p>

<p>"You need not take up for her, Liane. She
doesn't deserve it!" cried one and all, while Mary
Lang, the oldest and most staid of the six girls,
quickly offered to share her own room with Liane
if she would never return to the old woman.</p>

<p>She was an orphan, and rented a room with a
widow, living cozily at what she called "room-keeping,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and the girls had many jolly visits taking
tea with Mary.</p>

<p>Liane thanked her warmly for her offer.</p>

<p>"But will you come?" asked Mary.</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>The girl sighed heavily as she explained:</p>

<p>"Granny came to Mrs. Dorr's this morning, all
penitence for her fault, and begged me to come
home, promising never to beat me again."</p>

<p>"Do not trust her; do not go!" cried they all;
but it was useless.</p>

<p>"She is old and poor. How could she get along
without me? She would have to go to the poorhouse,
and think how cruelly that would disgrace
me!" cried Liane, who had no love for the old
wretch, but supported her through mingled pride
and pity.</p>

<p>And she actually returned to the shanty that
day when her work was done, much to the relief
of the old woman, who feared she had driven her
meek slave off forever.</p>

<p>"So you are back? That's a good girl!" she
said approvingly, and added: "They may tell
you, those foolish girls, that I am too strict with
you, Liane, but I'm an old woman, and I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
what's best for you, girl. It was through letting
your mother have her own way that she went to
her ruin; that's why I'm so strict on you."</p>

<p>"My mother went to her&mdash;ruin!" faltered
Liane, flushing crimson, but very curious, for she
had never been able to extract a word from
granny about her parents, except that they were
both dead and had been no credit to her while
living.</p>

<p>"Yes, her ruin," granny replied, with a malicious
side glance at the startled girl. "She ran
away from me to be an actress when she wasn't
but seventeen, and a year later she came back to
me with a baby in her arms&mdash;you! She had been
deceived and deserted, and you, poor thing, had
no lawful name but the one she had picked out of
a book&mdash;Liane Lester."</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven!" sobbed the girl, burying her
white face in her hands, thinking that this blow
was more cruel even than one of the old woman's
beatings.</p>

<p>At heart Liane had a strange pride, and she
was bitterly ashamed of her low origin and her
cruel grandmother, whom no one respected because
of her vile temper.</p>

<p>To be told now that she had no lawful name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
that her mother had been deceived and deserted,
was like a sword thrust in the poor girl's heart.</p>

<p>She sobbed bitterly, as granny added:</p>

<p>"I didn't never mean to tell you the truth, but
now that you are getting wild and willful, like
your mother was, it's best for you to know it, and
take her fate as a warning."</p>

<p>Liane knew the accusation was not true, but
she did not contradict it; she only sobbed:</p>

<p>"Did my mother die of a broken heart?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, the minx; she got well and ran
away again, and left you on my hands."</p>

<p>"Is she living now?"</p>

<p>"She is, for all I know to the contrary. But
she takes good care never to come near me, nor
to send me a dollar for your support."</p>

<p>"I take care of myself, and you, too, granny."</p>

<p>"Yes, the best you can; but she ought to help&mdash;the
ungrateful creature!" granny exclaimed so
earnestly that she could scarcely doubt the truth
of her story.</p>

<p>It was a cruel blow to Liane's pride, and up in
her bare little chamber under the eaves that night
she lay awake many hours sobbing hopelessly over
her fate.</p>

<p>"I would rather be dead than the daughter of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
woman who was deceived and deserted! Mr.
Devereaux would never give me a second thought
if he knew," she sighed, with burning cheeks, as
she sank into a restless sleep, troubled with
dreams in which her hero's magnetic, dark eyes
played the principal part&mdash;dreams so sweet that
she grieved when the cold gray light of dawn
glimmered upon her face and roused her to reality
and another day of toil.</p>

<p>Very eagerly the girls questioned her when she
reached Miss Bray's as to granny's mood, and she
answered quietly:</p>

<p>"No, she did not scold me or strike me this
time; she was kind in her way."</p>

<p>But she did not tell them granny's way of kindness,
for her heart sank with shame as she looked
around the group of her light-hearted friends,
thinking how different their lot was from hers;
all of them having honorable parentage, and
dreading lest they would not wish to associate
with her if they knew she had no right to her
pretty name, Liane Lester, that her wronged
mother had simply picked it out of a story book.</p>

<p>Miss Bray had a hurry order this morning&mdash;a
white gown ruffled to the waist&mdash;so she set all
the girls to work, and as they worked their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
tongues flew&mdash;they knew pretty nearly everything
that had happened in the village since yesterday.</p>

<p>The choice bit of gossip was that Miss Clarke's
maid, Sophie Nutter, had left her, and gone to
Boston.</p>

<p>"They say she had a sick spell night before last,
and went out of her head, talking awful things,
so that the servants were quite frightened, and
called up their mistress herself. Sophie had hysterical
spasms, and accused Miss Roma of dreadful
crimes right before her mother's face," said
Mary Lang.</p>

<p>"Miss Roma must have been very angry&mdash;she
has such a temper," cried Dolly, as she threaded
her needle.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Roma wasn't present, and her
mother took steps never to let her find it out, you
may be sure."</p>

<p>"It must have been something awful," said
Lottie Day.</p>

<p>"I should say so! She declared to Mrs. Clarke
she had seen Miss Roma push Mr. Devereaux
over the bluff and drown him! Just think&mdash;when
Mr. Devereaux had not been near the place, but
was lying at his hotel with a broken arm!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was all a dream," said Miss Bray from her
cutting board.</p>

<p>"Yes, but she could hardly be convinced yesterday
morning that she had not really seen Miss
Roma commit a murder. They had to send for
the doctor to tell her that Mr. Devereaux was
really alive at his hotel, having broken his arm
by a fall on the sands. They say she went off into
more hysterics when she heard that, and muttered:
'A fall over the cliff was more likely, but
how he escaped death and got to shore again puzzles
me. And why did she do it, anyway? It
must have been a lovers' quarrel. I must get
away from here. She will be pushing me over the
bluff next.' And she had her trunk packed and
went off to Boston, though she looked too ill to
leave her bed," added Mary Lang, who had had
the whole story straight from the housekeeper at
Cliffdene.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE BROKEN ENGAGEMENT.</p>


<p>"Oh, how rash and foolish I have been!"
thought Roma, the next day, when she heard of
Jesse Devereaux's accident.</p>

<p>"His arm broken by a fall on the sands last
night&mdash;most probably on his way to see me, poor
fellow! And in my angry resentment at my disappointment
I have broken our engagement!
How rash and foolish I am, and how much I regret
it! I must make it up with him at once, my
darling!" she cried repentantly, and hurried to
her mother.</p>

<p>"Mamma, you were right last night. I regret
my hasty action in dismissing Jesse without a
hearing. How can I make it up with him?"</p>

<p>"You can send another note of explanation,
asking his forgiveness," suggested Mrs. Clarke.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, if I could only go to him myself!"
she cried, impatient for the reconciliation.</p>

<p>"It would not be exactly proper, my dear."</p>

<p>"But we are engaged."</p>

<p>"You have broken the engagement."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Roma uttered a cry of grief and chagrin that
touched her mother's heart.</p>

<p>"Poor dear, you are suffering, as I foreboded,
for last night's folly," she sighed.</p>

<p>"Please don't lecture me, mamma. I'm
wretched enough without that!"</p>

<p>"I only meant to sympathize with you, dear."</p>

<p>"Then help me&mdash;that is the best sort of sympathy.
I suppose it wouldn't be improper for you
to call on Jesse, at his hotel, would it?"</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not."</p>

<p>"Then I will write my note to him, and you can
take it&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke assented, and was on the point of
starting when a messenger arrived with a note
for Roma, replying to hers of the night before.</p>

<p>In spite of his broken right arm, Jesse Devereaux
had managed a scrawl with his left hand,
and Roma tore it open with a burning face and
wildly beating heart, quickly mastering its contents,
which read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Devereaux accepts his dismissal with equanimity,
feeling sure from this display of Miss Clarke's hasty temper
that he has had a lucky escape.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was cool, curt, airy, almost to insolence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
a fitting match for her own; and Roma gasped
and almost fainted.</p>

<p>Where was all her boasting, now, that she
would teach him a lesson; that he would be back
in a day begging her to take back his ring?</p>

<p>She had met her match; she realized it now;
remembering, all too late, how hard he had been
to win; a lukewarm lover, after all, and perhaps
glad now of his release.</p>

<p>Oh, if she could but have recalled that silly note,
she would have given anything she possessed, for
all the heart she had had been lavished on him.</p>

<p>With a genuine sob of choking regret, she flung
the humiliating note to her mother, and sank into
a chair, her face hidden in her hands.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke read, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Really, he need not comment on your temper
while displaying an equally hasty one so plainly.
He must certainly be very angry, but I suppose
his suffering adds to his impatience."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he&mdash;will forgive me when he reads my
second note!" sobbed Roma.</p>

<p>"But you do not intend to send it now, Roma!"
exclaimed Mrs. Clarke, with a certain resentment
of her own at Jesse's brusqueness.</p>

<p>But Roma could be very inconsistent&mdash;overbearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
when it was permitted to her; humble
when cowed.</p>

<p>She lifted up a miserable face, replying
eagerly:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mamma, for I was plainly in the
wrong, and deserve that he should be angry with
me. But he will be only too glad to forgive me
when he reads my note of repentance. Please go
at once, dear mamma, and make my peace with
Jesse! You will know how to plead with him in
my behalf! Oh, don't look so cold and disapproving,
mamma, for I love him so it would break my
heart to lose him now. And&mdash;and&mdash;if he made
love to any other girl, I should like to&mdash;to&mdash;see
her lying dead at my feet! Oh, go; go quickly,
and hasten back to me with my ring again and
Jesse's forgiveness!"</p>

<p>She was half mad with anxiety and impatience,
and she almost thrust Mrs. Clarke from the room
in her eagerness for her return.</p>

<p>It mattered not that she could see plainly how
distasteful it was to the gentle lady to go on such
a mission; she insisted on obedience, and waited
with passionate impatience for her mother's return,
saying to herself:</p>

<p>"He is certainly very angry, but she will coax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
him to make up, and hereafter I will be very careful
not to let him slip me again. I can be humble
until we are married, and rule afterward.
Mamma will not dare leave him without getting
his forgiveness for me. She knows my temper,
and that I would blame her always if she failed
of success."</p>

<p>But there are some things that even a loving,
slavish mother cannot accomplish, even at the risk
of a child's anger. Jesse Devereaux's reconciliation
to Roma was one of them.</p>

<p>The mother returned after a time, pale and
trembling, to Roma, saying nervously:</p>

<p>"Call your pride to your aid, dear Roma, for
Jesse was obdurate, and would not consent to renew
the engagement. I am indeed sorry that I
humbled myself to ask it."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.</p>


<p>Jesse Devereaux had never spent a more unpleasant
half hour in his life than during Mrs.
Clarke's visit. He admired and esteemed the gentle
lady very much, and it pained him to tell her
that he no longer loved her daughter, and was
glad of his release.</p>

<p>Yet he did so kindly and courteously, though
he was well aware that no gentleness could really
soften the blow to her love and pride.</p>

<p>"I have been betrothed to your daughter only
two weeks, dear madam, but in that short time I
have discovered traits in her character that could
never harmonize with mine. We have both been
spoiled by indulgent parents; both are willful
and headstrong. Such natures do best wedded to
gentle, yielding ones. It is best for our future
happiness that we should separate, although I
should have kept faith with Roma, had she not
yielded to her hasty temper and broken the engagement,"
he said.</p>

<p>She looked at his pale, handsome face as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
rested on the sofa, and decided that he was only
holding out for pride's sake. Surely he must love
beautiful Roma still&mdash;he could not hate her so
soon.</p>

<p>"Roma is not headstrong, as you think; only
hasty and impulsive," she faltered. "See how she
has humbled herself to you in the depths of her
love. Why, I left her weeping most bitterly over
her fault, and praying for your forgiveness. How
can I go back and tell her you refuse it; that you
scorn her love?"</p>

<p>She was frightened, indeed, to return from
an unsuccessful mission to Roma. There were
tears in her imploring eyes as she gazed at him.</p>

<p>"I do not refuse her my forgiveness; I accord it
to her freely," he replied. "Neither do I scorn her
love, but I do not believe it can be very deep, else
she could not have been so angry with me last
night. And I am free to confess that my love
was not of the strongest, either, for I realize now
that I am glad of my freedom, if you will pardon
me for my frankness, dear lady."</p>

<p>How could she pardon aught that must wound
her daughter vitally? An angry flush rose into
her cheek, her blue eyes flashed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are cruelly frank!" she cried; and he answered:</p>

<p>"I lament the painful necessity, but circumstances
leave me no alternative, Mrs. Clarke. I
feel that I entered into an engagement too hastily,
and that its sudden rupture is a relief. I tender
my friendship to your daughter with profound
gratitude for her kindness, but I can never again
be her lover."</p>

<p>In the face of such frankness she sat dumb.
What was there to say that could move him?</p>

<p>Her heart sank at the thought of Roma's disappointment.
She rose unsteadily to her feet,
blinded by angry tears.</p>

<p>"I may still retain your friendship?" he
pleaded, but her lip curled in scorn.</p>

<p>"No, you are cruel and unjust to Roma. I
despise you!" she answered, in wrath, as she
stumbled from the room, wondering at his heartlessness.</p>

<p>She would not have wondered so much if she
could have known that Roma had never really
filled his heart, but that the glamour of her fascinations
and her open preference had somehow
drawn him into a proposal that had brought him
no happiness, save a sort of pride in winning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
beautiful belle and heiress from many competitors.
All the while he did not really love her; it
was just his pride and vanity that were flattered.</p>

<p>There had come a sudden, painful awakening
that fateful day, when rescuing Liane Lester's
veil. He had looked deep into those shy, lovely
eyes of hers, and felt his heart leap wildly, quickened
by a glance into new life.</p>

<p>Roma's eyes had never thrilled him that way;
he had never wondered at her great beauty; he
had never longed to take her in his arms and clasp
her to his heart at first sight. This was love&mdash;real
love, such as he had never felt for the proud
beauty he had rashly promised to marry.</p>

<p>In that first hour of his meeting with Liane, he
cursed himself for his madness in proposing to
Roma.</p>

<p>Yet, he was the soul of honor. He did not
even contemplate retreating from his position as
Roma's affianced husband. He only felt that he
must avoid the fatal beauty of Liane, lest he go
mad with despair at his cruel fate.</p>

<p>Then had followed the meeting with her again,
that night when he had so fortunately saved her
from the insults of a stranger and the brutality of
her old grandmother. How proud and glad he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
had been to defend her, even at the pain of a
broken arm; how he had loved her in that moment,
longed to shelter her on his breast from the
assaults of the cruel world.</p>

<p>He could never forget that moment when, overcome
by gratitude, the girl had bent and kissed his
hand, sending mad thrills of love through his
trembling frame.</p>

<p>Had he been free, he would have poured out
his full heart to her that moment, and the tender
stars would have looked down on a scene of the
purest love, where two hearts acknowledged each
other's sway in ecstasy.</p>

<p>But he was bound in the cruel fetters of another's
love, from which he could not in honor get
free. His heart must break in silence.</p>

<p>He had to hurry away from her abruptly to
hide the love he must not confess.</p>

<p>In his sorrow and suffering that night, judge
what happiness came to him with Roma's angry
letter, sent by special messenger, restoring his
ring and his freedom!</p>

<p>His heart sang pans of joy as he let his
thoughts cling lovingly to Liane, realizing that
now he might woo and win the shy, sweet maiden
for his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Very early in the morning he penned his note to
Roma, making it purposely curt and cold, that she
might not attempt a reconciliation.</p>

<p>He felt so grateful to her that he was not at all
angry, and thanked her in his heart for her summary
rejection.</p>

<p>The unpleasant interview with Mrs. Clarke
over, he dismissed the whole matter from his
mind, and gave all his thoughts to Liane, chafing
at the delay that must ensue from his forced confinement
to his room.</p>

<p>"You must let me get out of here as soon as
possible, doctor. I have something very important
to do!" he cried eagerly.</p>

<p>"Love-making, eh?" bantered the doctor, thinking
of Roma. "All right, my dear fellow. I shall
have you walking about in a few days, I trust;
but I warn you it will be a long while before you
can do any but left-handed hugging!"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" exclaimed his patient; but he colored
up to his brows. He was indeed thinking of how
impassionedly he would make love to Liane when
he saw her again.</p>

<p>"I shall ask her to marry me on the spot!" he
decided joyfully, "and&mdash;I hope I'm not vain&mdash;but
I don't believe she will say no. We must be married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
very soon, so I can take her away from her
wretched surroundings. That old grandmother
can be pensioned off. She shall never see Liane
again after she is my wife. Of course, the world
will say I've made a msalliance, but I'm rich
enough to please myself, and my darling is beautiful
enough to wear a crown."</p>

<p>The doctor found him the most impatient patient
in the world. He never complained of the
pain in his arm, though it was excruciating. He
only chafed at his confinement.</p>

<p>"I want to get out," he said. "Doctor, you
know I'm one of the judges at the Beauty Show
to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"I'm going to let you go with your arm in a
sling. Hang it all, I wouldn't miss it myself for
anything! Say, there's more than one beauty in
Stonecliff, but it goes without saying that you
judges will award the prize to Miss Clarke, eh?"
cried the jocose physician.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ROMA SEEKS A NEW MAID.</p>


<p>Roma's rage and grief at her mother's failure
to set matters straight between her and Devereaux
were beyond all expression.</p>

<p>But, for very pride's sake, she concealed the
deepest bitterness of her heart.</p>

<p>She could not accuse her gentle mother of
wanton carelessness, for the tears stood in her
deep-blue eyes as she told the story of her interview,
concluding sadly:</p>

<p>"Do not think, my darling, that I did not do my
best to bring him to reason, putting pride away,
and telling him how devotedly you loved him, and
that it would break your heart to lose him now.
He was cold and unresponsive to all my pleadings,
and as good as said he was glad to be free of you.
I confess I lost my temper at the last, and told him
I despised him, before I came away."</p>

<p>Roma did not speak, she only tapped the rich
carpet with a restless foot, indicative of a white
heat of repressed anger; but Mrs. Clarke did not
read her mood aright; she thought she was bearing
the blow with fortitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>In her keen sympathy she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is a cruel blow to your pride and love, my
daughter, and I only wish I knew how to comfort
you."</p>

<p>Roma lifted her white face and glittering eyes
to Mrs. Clarke's anxious scrutiny, and actually
laughed&mdash;a strange, mirthless laugh, that chilled
her mother's blood. Then she said, with seeming
coolness:</p>

<p>"You can comfort me right off, mamma, by
begging papa to give me those rubies I've wanted
so long! As for Jesse, he is only holding off from
pride! I shall win him back, never fear!"</p>

<p>"You shall have your rubies, dear," her mother
answered kindly, though she thought: "What a
strange girl? How can she think of rubies at
such a moment?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, mamma, you are very good to
me!" Roma answered prettily, in her gratitude for
the rubies; then, as Mrs. Clarke was going out,
she added: "I wonder if Sophie is well enough
to get up and wait on me. I am in need of her
services."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke paused in some embarrassment,
and answered:</p>

<p>"I shall have to lend you my own maid till I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
can get you another. Sophie Nutter left quite
abruptly this morning."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it. I disliked the girl, and I suspected
her of telling tales of me to you!" cried
Roma.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke neither affirmed nor denied the
charge. She simply said:</p>

<p>"We should be kind to our servants, Roma, if
we expect them to bear good witness for us."</p>

<p>"Kindness is wasted on the ungrateful things!"
Roma answered impatiently. "I must have another
maid immediately."</p>

<p>"But where shall we find her? Not in this little
town, I fear. So we must send to Boston."</p>

<p>"Wait! I have an idea, mamma!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I should like to have that neat little sewing girl
that altered my cape that night. She is so clever
with her needle, she would be a real treasure to
me, and save you many dressmaking bills."</p>

<p>"Would she be willing to come?"</p>

<p>"We can find out by asking the old woman she
lives with&mdash;you know, mamma, that old tumble-down
shanty at the end of town, coming out of
Cliffdene? It is a little more than a mile from
here. Liane Lester lives there with an old grandmother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
that beats her every day, I've heard, and
I've no doubt she would jump at the chance of a
situation here!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke forbore to remind her daughter
that she, too, had been accused of beating her
maid; she only said warningly:</p>

<p>"You would have to be kinder to her than you
were to Sophie, or she would not be likely to stay,
my dear."</p>

<p>"How could you believe Sophie's fibs on me?"
cried Roma petulantly; but Mrs. Clarke turned
the exclamation aside by saying:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better go and see about the
new maid at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, I think you might do it yourself!
I&mdash;I am too nervous and unhappy to attend to it
just now. Won't you just drive down into town
again and see about the girl?" answered Roma.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke did not relish the task, but she was
so used to bearing Roma's burdens that she assented
without a murmur, and went out again to
see about the new maid, sadly troubled in her
mind about what had happened last night, when
the delirious maid had told such shocking stories
on her daughter.</p>

<p>"It could not be true; of course not, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
shocking that Sophie should even have imagined
such awful things! It all came of Roma being
cross and impatient with her, and making a bad
impression on her mind. Now, if this young sewing
girl should consent to serve Roma, I shall
make it a point to see that she is not ill-used," she
thought, as her handsome carriage stopped at
Liane's humble home, and the footman opened the
door and helped her out.</p>

<p>She swept up the narrow walk to the door, an
imposing figure, thinking compassionately:</p>

<p>"What a wretched abode! It will be a pleasing
change to Liane Lester if the girl will consent to
come to Cliffdene."</p>

<p>She tapped on the open door, but no one replied,
though she saw the old woman's figure moving
about in the room beyond.</p>

<p>"She is deaf and cannot hear me. I will just
step in," she thought, suiting the action to the
word.</p>

<p>Granny was sweeping up the floor, but she
turned with a start, dropping her broom as a soft
hand touched her shoulder, and, confronting the
beautiful intruder, asked:</p>

<p>"Who are you? What do you want?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke smiled, as she replied:</p>

<p>"I am Mrs. Clarke, of Cliffdene. I wish to see
Liane Lester."</p>

<p>"Liane's down to her work at Miss Bray's,
ma'am, but you can tell me your business with her.
I'm her grandmother," snarled granny crossly.</p>

<p>"My daughter Roma has lost her maid; she
wishes to offer Liane the vacant place, with your
approval. She will have a pleasant home, and
much better wages than are paid to her by Miss
Bray for sewing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke had never seen Liane Lester, but
she felt a deep sympathy for her from what she
had heard, and was strangely eager to have her
come to Cliffdene.</p>

<p>So she waited impatiently for granny's reply,
and as she studied the homely figure before her,
a sudden light beamed in her eyes, and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"How strange! I recognize you all at once as
the woman who nursed me when my daughter
Roma was born. You have changed, but yet your
features are quite familiar. Oh, how you bring
back that awful time to me! Do you remember
how my child was stolen, and that I would have
died of a broken heart, only that she was restored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
to me almost at the last moment, when my life was
so quickly ebbing away?"</p>

<p>The quick tears of memory started to the lady's
eyes, but granny's fairly glared at her as she muttered:</p>

<p>"You are mistaken!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I cannot be! I recall you perfectly,"
declared Mrs. Clarke, who had an astonishing
memory for faces.</p>

<p>"I never saw you before in my whole life! I
never was a sick nurse!" declared the old woman,
so positively and angrily that Mrs. Clarke thought
that, after all, she might be mistaken.</p>

<p>"Really, it does not matter. I was misled by
a resemblance, and I thought you would be glad
to hear of your nurse child again," she said.</p>

<p>A strange eagerness appeared on the old
woman's face as she muttered:</p>

<p>"It's my misfortune that I haven't such a claim
on your kindness, ma'am. God knows I'd be glad
to meet with rich friends that would pity my poverty-stricken
old age!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke's white hand slipped readily into
her pocket, taking the hint, and granny was made
richer by a dollar, which she acknowledged with
profuse gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"And as for Liane going as maid to your
daughter, ma'am, I'd like to see this Miss Roma
first, before I give my consent. I want to see if
she looks like a kind young lady, that would not
scold and slap my granddaughter," she declared
cunningly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke colored, wondering if Sophie's
tales had reached the old woman's ears, but she
said quickly:</p>

<p>"I would insure kind treatment to your grandchild
if she came to serve my daughter."</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, ma'am. I believe you, but
will you humor an old woman's whim and persuade
Miss Roma to come to me herself?" persisted
granny, with veiled eagerness.</p>

<p>"I will do so if I can, but I cannot promise certainly,"
Mrs. Clarke replied, rather coldly, as she
rustled through the door.</p>

<p>She was vexed and disappointed. Everything
seemed to go against her that day. How angry
Roma would be at the old woman's obstinacy, and
how insolently she would talk to her, looking down
on her from her height of pride and position. It
was as well to give up the thought of having Liane
come at all.</p>

<p>And how strangely like the old woman was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Mrs. Jenks, the nurse she had had with her when
Roma was born. She was mistaken, of course,
since the old creature said so; but she had such
a good memory for faces, and she had never
thought of two such faces alike in the world.</p>

<p>But if Mrs. Clarke went away perturbed from
this rencontre, she left granny sadly flustrated
also.</p>

<p>The old creature sat down in the doorway, her
chin in her hands, and gazed with starting eyes at
the grand carriage from Cliffdene rolling away.</p>

<p>"Who would have dreamed such a thing?" she
muttered. "Here I have lived two years neighbor
to the Clarkes, and never suspected their identity,
and never heard their girl's name spoken before!
Well, well, well! And they want Liane to wait
on Roma. Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>She seemed to find the idea amusing, for she
kept laughing at intervals in a grim, mocking
fashion, while she watched the road to Cliffdene
as if she had seen a ghost from the past.</p>

<p>"Will the girl come, as I wish? Will she condescend
to cross old granny's humble threshold?
I should like to see her in her pride and beauty.
Perhaps she, too, might have a dollar to fling to
a poor old wretch like me!" she muttered darkly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE BEAUTY SHOW.</p>


<p>Roma was indeed surprised and angry at
granny's summons. She flatly refused to go, declaring:</p>

<p>"The insolence of the lower classes is indeed
insufferable. Why, I offered that girl a situation
much more profitable than the one she holds now,
and here that crazy old witch, her grandmother,
wishes to annoy me with all sorts of conditions!
Call on her, indeed, in her old rookery of a house!
I shall do nothing of the kind, but I will write a
note to the girl, at Miss Bray's, and I have no
doubt she will fairly jump at the chance, without
saying 'by your leave' to that old hag!"</p>

<p>Delighted at the idea of outwitting the insolent
old woman, as she deemed her, Roma quickly dispatched
a patronizing, supercilious note to Liane,
and waited impatiently for the reply.</p>

<p>She hardly gave another thought to poor Sophie
Nutter, now that she was gone. Least of all did
it enter her beautiful head that the maid had quit
in fear and horror at the crime she had seen her
commit that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke, in her tenderness over Roma's
feelings, had bound all the servants never to betray
Sophie's wild ravings to her daughter.</p>

<p>So, secure in her consciousness that her terrible
deed had had no witness, Roma tried to dismiss
the whole affair from her mind, believing that her
victim lay at the bottom of the sea and could never
rise again to menace her with threats of exposure,
as he had done that night, bringing down on himself
an awful fate.</p>

<p>The man she had remorselessly hurled from the
cliff to a watery grave belonged to an episode of
Roma's boarding-school days, that she hoped was
forever hidden from the knowledge of the world.
The thought of exposure and betrayal was intolerable.
It was a moment when she dare not hesitate.
Desperation made her reckless, branded
her soul with crime.</p>

<p>The strongest love of her life had been given
to Jesse Devereaux. Woe be to any one who came
between her and that selfish love! Woe be to
Devereaux himself when he scorned that love!
Turbulent passion, that brooked no obstacle,
burned fiercely in Roma's breast. Proud, vain,
self-indulgent, she would brook no opposition in
anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of all the five hundred girls whose portraits
had been accepted for the Beauty Show, there was
not one more eager than Roma to win the prize&mdash;not
for the money, but for the additional prestige
it would add to her belleship.</p>

<p>Her handsomest portrait had been offered, and
Roma had scrutinized it most anxiously, hour by
hour, searching for the slightest flaw.</p>

<p>She had a wealth of rich coloring in eyes, hair,
and complexion, but her features were not quite
regular; her nose was a trifle too large, her mouth
too wide. Aware of these defects, she would have
been a little uneasy, only that she counted on the
votes of her father and Devereaux as most certain.
Besides, she considered that her brilliant
social position must prove a trump card.</p>

<p>"The palm will surely be mine, both by reason
of beauty and belleship," she thought triumphantly,
sneering, as she added: "The town will
surely choose one of its own maidens for the
honor, and who would think of awarding the prize
to any one here except myself? True, they say
that all of Miss Bray's pretty sewing girls have
had their pictures accepted, and it's true that some
of them are rather pretty, especially that Liane
Lester, but who would think of giving a vote to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
common sewing girl? I don't fear any of them,
I'm sure! But, how I should hate any girl that
took the prize from me!" she concluded, with a
gleam of deadly jealousy in her great, flashing
eyes, that could burn like live coals in their peculiar,
reddish-brown shade.</p>

<p>But an element of uncertainty was added to the
situation, now, in the defection of Jesse Devereaux.</p>

<p>"What if, in his passionate resentment against
me, he should cast his vote for another?" she
thought, in dismay so great that she determined
to humble herself to the dust if she could but win
him back.</p>

<p>She sent him flowers every day, and, accompanying
them, love letters, in which she poured
out her grief and repentance; but, alas, all her
efforts fell on stony ground.</p>

<p>The recreant knight, busy with his new love
dream, scarcely wasted a thought on Roma. He
replied to her letters, thanking her for the flowers
and her kindly sentiments, assuring her that he
bore no malice, and forgave her for her folly; but
he added unequivocally that his fancy for her
was dead, and could never be resurrected.</p>

<p>"His fancy! He can call it a fancy now!" the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
girl moaned bitterly, and in that moment she
tasted, for the first time, the bitterness of a cruel
defeat, where she had been so confident of success.</p>

<p>She could not realize that he loved her no more,
that the fancy she had so carefully cultivated was
dead so soon! The pain and humiliation were
most bitter. She rued in dust and ashes her hasty
severance of her engagement.</p>

<p>Added to the bitterness of losing his love was
the pain of having him vote against her at the
Beauty Show.</p>

<p>"He will be sure to do so out of pure spite, even
if he thought me the most beautiful of all!" she
thought bitterly. "Oh, I wonder for whom he
will cast his vote! How I should hate her if I
knew! I&mdash;I could trample her pretty face beneath
my feet!"</p>

<p>In desperation she resolved to cultivate the
acquaintance of the artist, Malcolm Dean. He
was to be one of the judges, she knew. Perhaps
she could win him over to her side.</p>

<p>Gradually she took heart of hope again.</p>

<p>It could not be possible Jesse's heart had turned
against her so suddenly. No, no! When they
met again she would be able to draw him back
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>She had heard that he was going to be present
at the Beauty Show. She would wear her new
rubies and her most becoming gown for his eyes.</p>

<p>There were other girls than Roma planning to
look their prettiest that night, and one was Liane
Lester.</p>

<p>Her girl friends had persuaded her to send in
her picture with theirs, and all six had been photographed
in a large group by the Stonecliff artist.</p>

<p>No one could gainsay the fact that it was a
beautiful group, from the petite, flaxen-haired
Dolly, to the tall, stately brunette, Mary Lang.
Miss Bray was quite proud of them, and wished
she had not been too old and homely to compete
for the prize.</p>

<p>"How sweet they look in their plain white
gowns&mdash;as pretty as any millionaire's daughters!"
she said proudly. "Indeed, I don't see why
one of them can't take the prize? What if they
are just poor sewing girls? Almost any of them
is as pretty as Miss Clarke, with her fame as a
beauty! But her pa's money helped her to that!
Look at Liane Lester, now; that girl's pretty
enough for a princess, and if she had fine fixings,
like Roma Clarke, she could outshine her as the
sun outshines the stars! But, of course, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
wouldn't have Liane know I said it, because a
poor girl must never cultivate vanity," she concluded
to her crony, Widow Smith, who agreed to
everything she said.</p>

<p>Liane had been almost frightened at first when
the girls insisted on her going to the Beauty Show
to see the exhibition of photographs, and hear
the prize awarded.</p>

<p>"For if you should be chosen, you must be
there to receive the prize," cried Dolly.</p>

<p>"I could never dream of being chosen," the girl
cried, with a blush that made her lovelier than
ever.</p>

<p>"You must come! Tell granny you have thrown
off her yoke now, and intend to have a little fun,
like other young girls. If she rebels, tell her you
will leave her and live with me!" encouraged
Mary Lang.</p>

<p>"You mustn't miss it for all the world!" cried
Lottie Day vivaciously. "Did you know that the
ladies of the Methodist church intend to have a
supper in the town hall, also, that night?"</p>

<p>Little by little they tempted Liane to rebel
against granny's arbitrary will and accompany
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I have nothing to wear!" she sighed.</p>

<p>"Oh, a cheap, white muslin will do! It will look
real sweet by gaslight, with a ribbon round your
waist," suggested Miss Bray herself, and then
Liane's heart gave a thump of joy. She told them
about the five dollars Mrs. Clarke had given her
for the work on Roma's cape, and how she had
kept all knowledge of it from granny, longing to
enjoy the money herself.</p>

<p>"You were quite right, since she takes every
penny of your wages!" they all agreed, while Miss
Bray added kindly:</p>

<p>"You can get a sweet pattern of white muslin
and a ribbon for your waist and neck, with five
dollars. I will cut and fit your gown for nothing."</p>

<p>"And we girls will take parts of it home at
night and help you make it!" cried her young
friends.</p>

<p>"Oh, how good you all are to me! I hope I may
be able to return your favors some day," cried the
girl, grateful tears crowding into her beautiful
eyes.</p>

<p>And just then came the note from Roma Clarke,
offering Liane a situation as her maid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl shared the note with her friends, and
they were unanimously indignant.</p>

<p>"The idea of thinking that any of us would
stoop to be a maid!" they cried, while Liane, with
flushing cheeks, quickly indited a brief, courteous,
but very decided refusal of the young lady's offer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"THE QUEEN ROSE."</p>


<p>"What impudence! She thanks me for my
offer, but finds it quite impossible to accept. And
her note is worded as if written to an equal!"
cried Roma angrily, as she tossed Liane's answer
to her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke examined it somewhat curiously,
commenting on the neatness and correctness of
the writing.</p>

<p>"She has made good use of her limited opportunities
for education," she said.</p>

<p>"But, mamma, the idea of her refusing my
offer, to remain with Miss Bray at three dollars
a week."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there is a little pride mixed up with
her position. She may consider her present place
more genteel, my dear."</p>

<p>"I really do not see any difference to speak of.
Poor people are all alike to me," Roma cried
scornfully. "As for Liane Lester, I should like
to shake her! I suppose her pretty face has quite
turned her head with vanity! Why, mamma, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and those other sewing girls at Miss Bray's have
even sent their pictures to the Beauty Show."</p>

<p>"The competition was free to all, my dear, and
poverty is no bar to beauty. I have seen some of
the prettiest faces in the world among working
girls. But still, I do not suppose any of Miss
Bray's employees can compete with you in looks,"
returned Mrs. Clarke, with a complacent glance
at her handsome daughter.</p>

<p>"Thank you, mamma, but you haven't seen this
Lester girl, have you? She is really quite out of
the ordinary, with the most classic features, while
I&mdash;well, I confess my features are the weak point
in my beauty. I don't see why I didn't inherit
your regular features!" complained Roma.</p>

<p>"You do not resemble me, but you are not lacking
in beauty, dear. I suppose you must be more
like your father's family, though I never saw any
of them. But don't begin to worry, darling, lest
you should lose the prize. I feel sure of your success,"
soothed the gentle lady.</p>

<p>"But, mamma, there is Jesse, who will be sure
to vote against me for spite, and I'm afraid that
papa is the only one of the judges I can count
upon."</p>

<p>"You cannot count upon him, Roma, because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
has declined to serve, fearing to be accused of
partiality if he votes for you."</p>

<p>"Then I shall have to go entirely on my own
merits," Roma returned, with pretended carelessness,
but at heart she was furious at her father's
defection, only she knew it was useless to protest
against his decision. She had learned long ago
that she could not "wind him around her little finger,"
as she could her adoring mother.</p>

<p>Again her hopes recurred to Jesse Devereaux.
She must make every effort to lure him back.</p>

<p>Her mother's patient maid grew very tired
dressing Miss Roma for the show when the night
came.</p>

<p>"She was as fussy and particular as some old
maid! I did up her hair three times in succession
before it suited! My! But she was cross as
a wet hen! I believe she would have slapped me
in the face if she had dared! I hope to goodness
she may fail to get the prize, though I wouldn't
have dear Mrs. Clarke hear me say so for anything
in the world! But I'm just hoping and praying
that some poor girl that needs the money may
get that hundred dollars!" exclaimed the maid to
her confidante, the housekeeper.</p>

<p>There was not one among the servants but disliked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the arrogant heiress, who treated them as if
they were no more than the dust beneath her
dainty feet. They whispered among themselves
that it was strange that such a sweet, kind lady as
Mrs. Clarke should have such a proud, hateful
daughter.</p>

<p>While Roma was arraying herself in the finest
of silk and lace, set off by the coveted new rubies,
Liane Lester was making her simple toilet at the
home of Mary Lang, with whom she had promised
to attend the show.</p>

<p>Granny had most grudgingly given her consent
to Liane's spending the night with Mary, since
she dared not offer any violent opposition. Since
Liane had threatened open rebellion to her
tyranny, the old woman was somewhat cowed.</p>

<p>Liane put up her beautiful, curling tresses into
the simplest of knots, but she did not need an
elaborate coiffure for the chestnut glory of rippling,
sun-flecked locks. It was a crown of beauty
in itself.</p>

<p>She put on the crisp, white gown she had
bought with Mrs. Clarke's gift, and Mary helped
to tie the soft ribbons at her waist and neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, you lovely thing! You look sweet enough
to eat!" she cried. "Now, then, put on the roses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
your mysterious admirer sent you to wear, and
we will be off."</p>

<p>Liane blushed divinely as she fastened at her
waist a great bunch of heavy-headed pink roses,
that had been sent to Miss Bray's late that afternoon,
with an anonymous card that simply read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Fair Queen Rose</span>: Please wear these sister flowers at
the Beauty Show to-night.</p></blockquote>

<p>No name was signed, but the merry girls all
declared that Liane had caught a beau at last, and
that he would be sure to declare himself to-night.
They persuaded her to wear the roses, though she
was frightened at the very idea.</p>

<p>"Suppose some great, ugly ogre comes up to
claim me!" she exclaimed apprehensively, as she
pinned them on and set off, all in a flutter of excitement,
for the town hall, clinging to Mary's
arm, for she was quite nervous over the prospect
of the evening's pleasure.</p>

<p>Now, as she passed along the lighted streets
to the festive scene, and saw others, also gayly
bedecked, hurrying to the same destination, she
felt a thrill of pleasant participation quite new and
exhilarating.</p>

<p>"Just see what I have missed all my life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
through granny's hardness!" she murmured
plaintively to Mary, who squeezed her arm lovingly,
and answered:</p>

<p>"Poor dear!"</p>

<p>The hall was already crowded with people, and
the supper of the Methodist ladies was busily in
progress when they entered the place that was
gayly decorated with flowers and bunting, framing
the pictures that lined the walls.</p>

<p>"Let us walk around and look at the beauties,"
Mary said, and, following the example of the
other visitors, they mingled with the crowd and
feasted their eyes on the five hundred pretty faces
that were deemed worthy to compete for the prize.</p>

<p>They soon found out that Miss Clarke's portrait
and the group of six sewing girls claimed
more attention than any others.</p>

<p>But there were many eyes that turned from the
pictured to the living beauty, and whispers went
round that drew many eyes to Liane, wondering
at her marvelous grace.</p>

<p>Liane had never appeared at a public function
in the town before, and many of the people
thought she was a stranger. Curious whispers
ran from lip to lip:</p>

<p>"Who is the lovely girl with the pink roses?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Roma, in her rich gown and sparkling rubies,
heard the question, and bit her lips till the blood
almost started.</p>

<p>"It is only one of the dressmaker's sewing
girls!" she said haughtily, and started across the
room to her mother, who had paused to speak to
Jesse Devereaux.</p>

<p>He had just entered, looking pale and superbly
handsome; but with his right arm in a sling, and
the lady, for Roma's sake, resolved to forget her
resentment and try to propitiate him.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I was too hasty that morning,"
she said gently. "Will you forgive me and be
friends again, Jesse?"</p>

<p>"Gladly," he replied, for he valued her good
opinion, little as he cared for her proud, overbearing
daughter.</p>

<p>The next moment Roma, coming up to them,
heard her mother exclaim, to her infinite chagrin:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Jesse, who is that perfectly lovely girl
in the white gown with the pink roses at her
waist?"</p>

<p>Jesse looked quickly, and saw Liane again for
the first time since that eventful evening on the
beach, when he had saved her from insult and injury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
His heart gave a strangling throb of joy
and love, mingled with pride in her peerless loveliness.</p>

<p>"You are right. She is peerless," he answered,
in a deep voice, freighted with emotion. "Her
name is Liane Lester."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" almost shrieked the lady in her
surprise; but at that moment Roma confronted
them, her proud face pale, her eyes gleaming,
murmuring:</p>

<p>"Oh, Jesse, how glad I am to see you out again!
No wonder you were cross with me, suffering as
you were with your poor arm. But I forgive you
all."</p>

<p>"I thank you," he replied courteously, and
Roma took her station at his side quite as if she
had the old right.</p>

<p>He was vexed, for he was anxious to cross over
to Liane and ask her to have an ice with him.
Then he would keep at her side all the rest of the
evening. He would see her home, too, and before
they parted he would tell her all his love, and ask
for her hand.</p>

<p>With these ecstatic anticipations in his mind,
it was cruel torture to be kept away from her
against his will by the two ladies, and, worst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
all, with an air as if they had a right to monopolize
him all the evening.</p>

<p>In desperation he asked them to take an ice
with him, vowing to himself he would escape directly
afterward.</p>

<p>But Roma was thirsty that evening, it seemed.
She took two ices, and trifled over them, her
mother waiting patiently, while Jesse, outwardly
cool and courteous, inwardly cursed his untoward
fate, for he saw other men seeking introductions
to Liane, and loading her with attentions, carried
away by the charm of her beauty.</p>

<p>Still he could not shake off Roma without absolute
rudeness, for she clung to his arm persistently,
though it was near the hour for the announcement
of the award of the evening, and yet
he had not spoken one word to fair Liane, the
queen of his heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly Malcolm Dean ascended the rostrum,
and the gay, laughing groups about the hall became
intensely still, waiting for his verdict.</p>

<p>"I am no orator," he smiled. "So I will briefly
announce, as a member of the committee of the
beauty contest, that we examined the pictures in
detail to-day, and unanimously award the prize
for most perfect beauty to Miss Liane Lester!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>A breathless hush had fallen on the crowd as
Malcolm Dean's voice was heard speaking, and
every ear was strained, not to lose a word&mdash;for
many a fair young girl was listening in feverish
excitement, hoping to hear her own name.</p>

<p>Roma's heart gave a wild leap, her eyes flashed,
her cheeks paled, and she half rose from her seat
in uncontrollable excitement.</p>

<p>But the suspense of the aspirants for the prize
lasted but a moment, for Malcolm Dean purposely
made his announcement audible to every one in
the hall:</p>

<p>"Miss Liane Lester!"</p>

<p>The name ran from lip to lip in excited tones,
while many a young heart sank with disappointment,
so many had hoped to be chosen queen of
beauty, caring more for the honor even than the
money.</p>

<p>Then the voices swelled into plaudits, and
Liane, shrinking with bashful joy, heard her name
shouted from eager lips:</p>

<p>"Miss Lester! Miss Lester!"</p>

<p>Roma had uttered a stifling gasp of disappointment,
and sank heavily back into her seat.</p>

<p>"She is the most beautiful girl I ever saw!"
cried Jesse impulsively. It was cruel to tell Roma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
this, and he realized it, but his heart was on his
lips. He could not check it, though he saw the
deadly fire of hate leap into her flashing eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke touched her daughter's arm caressingly,
saying:</p>

<p>"Do not feel so badly over it, Roma, darling.
No doubt the committee were governed somewhat
by partiality, thinking that the prize ought to be
given some poor girl who needed the money."</p>

<p>Jesse felt the delicate thrust, and answered
quickly:</p>

<p>"You were struck with her beauty yourself,
Mrs. Clarke!"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is a very pretty girl," she replied,
rather carelessly, then paused, as Malcolm Dean
lifted his hand for silence, and said in the hush
that followed:</p>

<p>"Will Miss Lester please come forward and receive
the prize?"</p>

<p>A wild impulse came to Devereaux to escort
Liane forward. How proud he would be to take
that little fluttering hand and lead her to the
rostrum to receive the award! He knew that
every eye would be on them, that it would be a
virtual declaration of his sentiments toward her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
but he gloried in the thought. He rose quickly,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, please!"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Clarke's voice, cold and grating, fell
on his ear:</p>

<p>"Please escort Roma to the open air&mdash;to the
carriage! Do you not see that she is almost
fainting?"</p>

<p>Roma was indeed drooping heavily against her
mother, in pretended weakness. Her ruse had its
effect. Jesse had to offer his arm and lead her
from the room, followed by her mother. After
some little delay their carriage was found, and,
while placing them in it, Mrs. Clarke said coolly:</p>

<p>"Now if you will find my husband and send
him to us, you will add greatly to the obligation
you have placed us under."</p>

<p>He bowed silently and hurried away, meeting
Mr. Clarke, fortunately, coming out. A hasty
explanation, and they parted, Devereaux returning
to the room, wild to speak to Liane after all
this baffling delay.</p>

<p>But the prize had been presented, and Liane
was surrounded by an obsequious crowd, offering
eager congratulations.</p>

<p>By her side stood the handsome young artist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Malcolm Dean, gazing with rapt admiration on
her shy, blushing face, and then Devereaux remembered
that the artist had said, while they
were deciding on the pictures that afternoon, that
this was surely the fairest face in the whole
world, and he should not rest until he knew the
original.</p>

<p>"If the counterfeit presentiment can be so
charming, how much more lovely, the original!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>And now by his looks Devereaux saw that his
anticipations were more than realized. The ethereal
charm of Liane's beauty held him as by a
spell.</p>

<p>It seemed to Liane as if she had fallen asleep
and waked in a brighter world.</p>

<p>But an hour ago she had been poor little Liane
Lester, the humble sewing girl, who had spent
her little fortune, five dollars, the largest sum she
had ever possessed at once in her life, on this
simple white gown for the festal occasion. Now
she stood there, the centre of admiring congratulations,
receiving introductions and alternately
bowing and smiling like some great beauty and
heiress.</p>

<p>She felt like an heiress, indeed, with that crisp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
new hundred-dollar bill tucked into her belt, and
her cheeks glowed with shy pride and joy, for she
had dared to indulge some trembling daydreams
over gaining the prize, and now she hoped they
might be realized.</p>

<p>There were sad hearts there, too, for many a
vain little maiden was disappointed, among them
Dolly Dorr, who stifled her chagrin, however,
and kissed Liane very sweetly, saying:</p>

<p>"Don't forget that I persuaded you to compete
for the prize, although I was afraid all the time
you would carry it off from us all."</p>

<p>Every one laughed at Dolly's nave speech.
She was such a frank, pretty little thing, and,
next to Liane, the prettiest girl in Miss Bray's
employ.</p>

<p>But among all the disappointed ones, no one
had been so vexed as to leave the scene like Roma,
and it was soon whispered through the room that
she had scolded her lover for giving his vote to
Liane instead of herself.</p>

<p>"I heard them quarreling; I was just behind
Mrs. Clarke," said the lady who had started the
report, and she added that Roma had been taken
almost fainting to her carriage, unwilling to remain
and witness her rival's triumph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>There were many who rejoiced over Roma's
defeat, and others who wondered at Devereaux's
disloyalty.</p>

<p>He should have paid her the compliment of his
vote, since it could have made no difference in the
result, they said.</p>

<p>But Devereaux, returning to the hall, eager to
speak to Liane, and indifferent to comments on
his actions, was forced to stand on the verge of
the crowd waiting his turn, till Dolly Dorr, espying
him, hastened to his side.</p>

<p>She said to herself that here was one prize, at
least, that Liane had not won yet, and she would
lose no time trying to make good a claim.</p>

<p>"If he has quarreled with Miss Clarke, so much
the better. Hearts are often caught in the rebound,"
she thought eagerly, as she engaged his
attention with some bantering words.</p>

<p>Devereaux smiled kindly on the sunny-haired
little maiden, but she found it impossible to engross
his attention.</p>

<p>She soon saw that his whole mind was fixed on
Liane, and he could not keep from watching her
face, until Dolly said quite crossly:</p>

<p>"You are like all the rest! You cannot keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
your eyes from off Liane Lester, now that she
has taken the beauty prize!"</p>

<p>Devereaux answered dreamily:</p>

<p>"I could look at her forever!"</p>

<p>His brilliant, dark eyes glowed and softened
with tenderness, and a passionate flush reddened
his smooth olive cheek.</p>

<p>Dolly stared, and said sharply:</p>

<p>"Perhaps Miss Clarke wouldn't like that so
well!"</p>

<p>"What has she to do with my looking at Miss
Lester?" he cried impatiently.</p>

<p>"But aren't you engaged to Miss Clarke?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not!"</p>

<p>"But everybody says so!"</p>

<p>"Everybody is mistaken."</p>

<p>Dolly's eyes beamed with joy as she cried
gayly:</p>

<p>"Then you are free, Mr. Devereaux?"</p>

<p>He answered with a happy laugh:</p>

<p>"Free as the wind&mdash;free to look at Miss Lester
as much as I choose&mdash;or as long as she will allow
me."</p>

<p>This did not please Dolly at all, so she said
spitefully:</p>

<p>"I dare say she doesn't care whether you look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
at her or not! She has no eager eyes for any one
but that handsome Mr. Dean, and he has been
standing beside her ever since he gave her the
prize, and walked back to her seat with her, just
as if they were lovers."</p>

<p>"You are trying to make me jealous, Miss
Dolly!" he laughed, unwilling for her to perceive
the pain she gave him.</p>

<p>And he added, as some of the crowd around
Liane moved aside:</p>

<p>"Please excuse me while I speak to Miss Lester."</p>

<p>Dolly made an angry little pout at him as he
moved away. She had forgiven Liane for winning
the prize of beauty, but if she carried off
Devereaux's heart, too, why, that would be quite
different. Liane knew how Dolly had set her
heart on him. It would be mean if she came between
them, she thought.</p>

<p>She managed to get near them when they met,
and marked Liane's blush and smile of pleasure.</p>

<p>"And she always pretended not to care for
flirting! But I suppose she will turn over a new
leaf from to-night," she muttered jealously, as
she edged nearer, trying to overhear everything
that passed between the pair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>She had one triumph, at least, when she heard
Devereaux prefer a low request to walk home
with Liane that evening.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, but&mdash;I have already promised
Mr. Dean," the girl murmured back, in regretful
tones.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">EDMUND CLARKE'S SUSPICION.</p>


<p>Roma Clarke gave her parents a very uncomfortable
quarter of an hour riding home that
evening.</p>

<p>She threw pride to the winds, and raved in
grief and anger at her defeat in the contest for
the beauty prize, charging it most bitterly at the
door of Jesse Devereaux.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke learned for the first time now of
the broken engagement, and, on finding that it
was Roma's fault, he could not help censuring her
severely for the folly by which she had lost her
lover.</p>

<p>He thought bitterly in his heart: "Ah, how
different my own sweet daughter must have been
from this ill-tempered, coarse-grained girl who
betrays her low origin in spite of the good bringing
up and fine education she has received! My
poor wife! How disappointed she must feel at
heart, in spite of her brave show of affection and
sympathy! And, as for Jesse Devereaux, he is a
splendid young fellow, and has had a lucky escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
from Roma's toils. I cannot feel that she will
make any man a lovable wife, though I shall be
glad enough to have her married off my hands!"</p>

<p>When Roma had gone, sobbing, to her room,
he talked very earnestly to her mother, somewhat
blaming her for encouraging the girl's willful
temper.</p>

<p>"She is spoiled and selfish," he declared. "I
for one am willing to own that the prize was well
given to Miss Lester. She is very lovely&mdash;far
lovelier than Roma!"</p>

<p>"How can you say so of our dear girl?" Mrs.
Clarke cried reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Because, my dear wife, my eyes are not
blinded, like yours, by love and partiality, and
thus I can do justice to others," he answered
firmly.</p>

<p>"You have never loved our daughter as you
should. Therefore, I have felt it my duty to love
and cherish her the more!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>He took her tenderly in his arms, and kissed
the beautiful, quivering lips, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Oh, my love, if our daughter were more like
you, I could love her a hundredfold better! But,
alas, she is so different, both in beauty and disposition,
from my angel wife!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have fancied she must be like your own relations,
Edmund."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," he replied evasively, continuing:</p>

<p>"This girl who took the prize this evening won
my admiration, darling, because she has a wonderful
likeness to you in your young days, Elinor;
when we were first married."</p>

<p>"Oh, Edmund, I was never so exquisitely beautiful!"
she cried, blushing like a girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed; quite as beautiful as Liane
Lester&mdash;and very lovely still," he answered, gazing
into her eyes with the admiration of a lover,
giving her all the tenderness he withheld from
Roma, his unloved daughter.</p>

<p>She nestled close to his breast, delighted at his
praises, and presently she said:</p>

<p>"It is rather a coincidence, your fancying that
Miss Lester looks like me, while I imagine that
her grandmother&mdash;a dreadful old creature, by the
way&mdash;resembles Mrs. Jenks, the old woman who
nursed me when Roma was born."</p>

<p>Some startled questioning from her husband
brought out the whole story of her visit to
granny.</p>

<p>"Of course I was mistaken in taking her for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Mrs. Jenks, but the old crone needn't have been so
vexed over it," she said.</p>

<p>Edmund Clarke was startled, agitated, by what
she had told him, but he did not permit her to
perceive it.</p>

<p>He thought:</p>

<p>"What if I have stumbled on the solution of a
terrible mystery? The likeness of Liane Lester
to my wife is most startling, and, coupled with
other circumstances surrounding her, might almost
point to her being my lost daughter!"</p>

<p>He trembled like a leaf with sudden excitement.</p>

<p>"I must see this old woman&mdash;and to-night! I
cannot bear the suspense until to-morrow!" he
thought, and said to his wife artfully:</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am selfish, keeping you from poor
Roma in her distress."</p>

<p>"I will go to her at once, poor child," she said,
lifting her fair head from his breast.</p>

<p>"And I will take a walk while I smoke," he replied,
leaving her with a tender kiss.</p>

<p>He lighted a cigar, and started eagerly for the
cottage of granny, hoping to find her alone ere
Liane returned from the hall.</p>

<p>His whole soul was shaken with eager emotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
from what his wife had told him about the old
woman's identity.</p>

<p>In the cool, clean September moonlight he
strode along the beach, eager-hearted as a boy,
in the trembling hope of finding his lost child
again.</p>

<p>What joy it would be to find her in the person
of lovely Liane, who had already touched his
heart with a subtle tenderness by the wonderful
likeness that brought back so vividly his wife's
lost youth in the days when they had first loved
with that holy love that crowned their lives with
lasting joy. Not one cloud had marred their happiness
save the loss of their infant daughter.</p>

<p>He had restored what happiness he could to
Elinor by the substitution of a spurious child, but
for himself there must ever be an aching void
in his heart till the lost was found again.</p>

<p>He stepped along briskly in the moonlight, and
to his surprise and joy he found the old woman
leaning over the front gate in a dejected attitude,
as if loneliness had driven her outdoors to seek
companionship with nature.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mrs. Jenks, good evening!" he exclaimed
abruptly, pausing in front of her and lifting
his hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Granny started wildly, and snapped:</p>

<p>"I don't know you!"</p>

<p>"You have a poor memory," laughed Mr.
Clarke. "Now, I knew you at once as Mrs. Jenks,
who nursed my wife when our daughter Roma
was born. My name is Edmund Clarke. We
used to live in Brookline. I sold my property
there and moved away when Roma was an infant."</p>

<p>"I never heard of Brookline before, nor you,
either!" snapped granny.</p>

<p>"Your memory is bad, as I said before, but you
won't deny that your name is Jenks?" Mr. Clarke
returned.</p>

<p>As the whole town knew her by that name, she
felt that denial was useless, but she preserved a
stubborn silence, and he continued:</p>

<p>"I came to ask you, granny, how you came by
such a beautiful granddaughter."</p>

<p>"Humph! The same way as other people come
by grandchildren, I s'pose. My daughter ran
away to be an actress, and came back in a year
without a wedding ring, and left her baby on my
hands, while she disappeared again forever," returned
granny, with an air of such apparent
truthfulness that he was staggered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>He was silent a moment, then returned to the
charge.</p>

<p>"How old is Liane?"</p>

<p>"Only seventeen her next birthday."</p>

<p>"I should have taken her for quite eighteen."</p>

<p>"Then you would have made a mistake."</p>

<p>"Is her mother dead?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I never heard of her after she
ran away and left her baby on my hands."</p>

<p>"Eighteen years ago?"</p>

<p>"No; not quite seventeen, I told you, sir."</p>

<p>"And you do not really remember Mrs. Clarke,
whom you nursed at Brookline eighteen years
ago? Come, it ought to be fresh in your memory.
Do you not recall the distressing facts in the case?
The infant was stolen from my wife's breast, and
she was dying of the shock when a spurious
daughter was imposed on her, and she recovered.
You, Mrs. Jenks, were sent to the foundling asylum
for the child, and laid it on Mrs. Clarke's
breast, restoring her to hope again. You cannot
have forgotten!"</p>

<p>Granny Jenks looked at him angrily in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>"You must be crazy! I don't know you, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
don't care anything about your family history!
Go away!" she exclaimed fiercely.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke was baffled, but not convinced. He
stood his ground, saying firmly:</p>

<p>"You may bluster all you please, Granny Jenks,
but you cannot shake my conviction that you are
the wretch that stole my daughter, and placed a
foundling in her place to deceive and make
wretched my poor wife. This girl, Liane Lester,
is the image of my wife, and I am almost persuaded
she is my own daughter. If I have guessed
the truth it will be wiser for you to confess the
fraud at once, for denial now will be useless. I
believe I am on the right track at last, and I will
never stop till I uncover the truth. And&mdash;the
more trouble you give me, the greater will be your
punishment."</p>

<p>His dark eyes flashed menacingly, and the
hardened old woman actually shivered with fear
for an instant. Then she shook off the feeling,
and turned from him angrily, rentering her
house, and snarling from the doorway:</p>

<p>"I know nothing about your child, you crazy
fool! Go away!"</p>

<p class="chaptitle">ROMA FINDS AN ALLY.</p>


<p>Dolly Dorr was right. Handsome Malcolm
Dean had never quitted Liane's side since the moment
he had clasped her hand in congratulating
her on her triumph as queen of beauty.</p>

<p>He remained by her side, enraptured with her
beauty and her bashful grace, and he lost no time
in preferring a request to walk home with her
that night, thinking to himself how sweet it would
be to walk with her beneath the brilliant moonlight,
the little hand resting on his arm, while
the low, musical voice answered his remarks with
the timidity that showed how unconscious she was
of her own enchanting beauty.</p>

<p>He could scarcely credit what they had told
him this afternoon when examining the portraits:
that Liane Lester was only a poor sewing girl,
with a cruel grandmother, who beat her upon the
slightest pretext, and never permitted her to have
a lover.</p>

<p>"She looks like a young princess. It is a wonder
that some brave young man has not eloped
with her before now," he declared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Every one is afraid of Granny Jenks," they
replied; but Jesse Devereaux only remained
gravely silent. He had decided to win sweet Liane
for his own, in spite of a hundred vixenish grannies.</p>

<p>He had sent her the fragrant roses to wear,
determining to disclose his identity that night, and
to win her sweet promise to be his bride.</p>

<p>Now his plans were all spoiled by the artist's
sudden infatuation, and he could have cursed
Roma for the spiteful man&oelig;uvring that had kept
him an unwilling captive, while Liane was drifting
beyond his reach.</p>

<p>All his pleasure was over for to-night, yet he
did not give up hope for the future. His dark
eyes had not failed to detect the joy in her glance,
and the blush on her cheek at their meeting, and
his ears had caught the little regretful ring in
her voice, as she whispered that she had already
promised Mr. Dean.</p>

<p>Presently the people all began to go away, and
with keen pain he saw Liane leaving with her
new admirer, her little hand resting like a snowflake
on his black coat sleeve.</p>

<p>"But it shall be my turn to-morrow," he vowed
to himself, turning away with a jealous pang, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
pretending not to see Dolly Dorr, who had lingered
purposely in his way, hoping he would see
her home.</p>

<p>Disappointed in her little scheme, she rather
crossly accepted the offer of a dapper dry-goods
clerk, and went off on his arm, laughing with
forced gayety as she passed Devereaux, to let him
see that she did not care.</p>

<p>Devereaux did not even hear the laughter of
the piqued little flirt. He could think of nothing
but his keen disappointment over Liane. He returned
to his hotel in the sulks.</p>

<p>After all his pleasant anticipations, his disappointment
was keen and bitter.</p>

<p>"How can I wait until to-morrow?" he muttered,
throwing himself down disconsolately into
a chair.</p>

<p>Suddenly a messenger entered with a telegram,
and, tearing it hastily open, he read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Come at once. Father has had a stroke of apoplexy.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Lyde.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Lyde was his only sister, married a year before,
and a leader in society. He could fancy how helpless
she would be at this juncture&mdash;the pretty,
petted girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Filial grief and affection drove even the
thought of Liane temporarily from his mind.</p>

<p>Calling in a man to pack his effects, he left on
the earliest train for his home in Boston.</p>

<p>But as the train rushed on through the night
and darkness, Liane blended with his troubled
thoughts, and he resolved that he would write to
her at the earliest opportunity. He would not
leave the field clear for his enamored rival.</p>

<p>He realized, too, that the clever and handsome
artist would be a dangerous rival; still, he felt
sure that Liane had some preference for himself.
On this he based his hopes for Malcolm Dean's
failure.</p>

<p>"She will not forget that night upon the beach,
and the opportune service I did her. Her grateful
little heart will not turn from me," he thought
hopefully.</p>

<p>Malcolm Dean was the only one he could think
of as likely to come between him and Liane. He
had not an apprehension as to Roma Clarke's
baleful jealousy. And yet he should have remembered
the hate that had flashed from her eyes
and hissed in her voice when she taxed him with
voting for Liane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, she had nearly fainted when he was excusing
himself to speak to her successful rival.</p>

<p>And even now, while the fast-flying train bore
him swiftly from Stonecliff, Roma paced her
chamber floor like one distraught, wringing her
hands and alternately bewailing her fate and vowing
vengeance.</p>

<p>Before Roma's angry eyes seemed to move constantly
the vision of her rival in her exquisite
beauty. Liane, in her girlish white gown, with
the fragrant pink roses at her slender waist&mdash;Liane,
the humble sewing girl she had despised,
but who had now become her hated rival.</p>

<p>Jesse Devereaux admired her; thought her the
loveliest girl in the world. Perhaps, even, he was
in love with her. That was why he had taken so
gladly the dismissal she had so rashly given.</p>

<p>A fever of unavailing regret burned in Roma's
veins, the fires of jealous hate gleamed in her
flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"I would gladly see her dead at my feet," she
cried furiously.</p>

<p>Before she sought her pillow, she had resolved
on a plan to forestall Devereaux's courtship.</p>

<p>She would go to-morrow morning to see the
wicked old grandmother of Liane; she would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
a good excuse, because the old woman had desired
the visit, and she would tell her that Devereaux
was engaged to herself, and warn her not to permit
her granddaughter to accept attentions that
could mean nothing but evil. She would even
bribe the old woman, if necessary. She was ready
to make any sacrifice to punish Jesse for what she
called to herself his perfidy, ignoring the fact that
she had set him free to woo whom he would.</p>

<p>Granny was tidying up her floor next morning,
when a footstep on the threshold made her start
and look around at a vision of elegance and beauty
framed in sunshine that made the coppery waves
of her hair shine lurid red as the girl bowed
courteously, saying:</p>

<p>"I am Miss Clarke. Mamma said you wished
to see me."</p>

<p>Granny dropped her broom and sank into a
chair, staring with dazed eyes at the radiant
beauty in her silken gown.</p>

<p>As no invitation to enter was forthcoming,
Roma stepped in and seated herself, with a supercilious
glance at the shabby surroundings. She
thought to herself disdainfully:</p>

<p>"To think of being rivaled in both beauty and
love by a low-born girl raised in a hovel!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet she saw that everything was scrupulously
clean and neat, as though Liane made the best of
what she had.</p>

<p>The old woman, without speaking a word,
stared at Roma with eager eyes, as if feasting on
her beauty, a tribute to her vanity that pleased
Roma well, so she smiled graciously and waited
with unwonted patience until granny heaved a
long sigh, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is a pleasure to behold you at last, Miss
Roma, as a beauty and an heiress! Ah, you must
be very happy!"</p>

<p>The young girl sighed mournfully:</p>

<p>"Wealth and beauty cannot give happiness
when one's lover is fickle, flirting with poor girls
at the expense of their reputations."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" gasped the old woman,
and somehow Roma felt that she was making a
favorable impression, and did not hesitate to add:</p>

<p>"I am speaking of your granddaughter, Liane
Lester. The girl is rather pretty, and I suppose
that her vanity makes her ambitious to marry
rich. She flirts with every young man she sees,
and lately she has been making eyes at my betrothed
husband, Jesse Devereaux, a handsome
young millionaire. He loves me as he does his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
life, but he is a born flirt, and he is amusing himself
with Liane in spite of my objections. So I
thought I would come and ask you to scold the girl
for her boldness."</p>

<p>"Scold her! That I will, and whip her, too, if
you say so! I will do anything to please you,
beautiful lady," whimpered granny, moving closer
to Roma, and furtively stroking her rich dress
with a skinny, clawlike hand, while she looked at
the girl with eager eyes.</p>

<p>Roma frowned a little at this demonstration of
tenderness, but she was glad the old woman took
it so calmly about Liane, and answered coolly:</p>

<p>"So that you keep them apart, I do not care
how much you whip her, for her boldness deserves
a check, and I suppose that you cannot restrain
her, except by beating."</p>

<p>She was surprised and almost shocked as
granny whispered hoarsely:</p>

<p>"I would beat her&mdash;yes; I would kill her before
she should steal your grand lover, darling!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"A DYING MOTHER."</p>


<p>Even Roma's cruel heart was somewhat
shocked at granny's malevolence toward her beautiful
young granddaughter, but she did not rebuke
the old hag; she only resolved to make capital
of it. So she said:</p>

<p>"I don't want you to kill her, but I wish you
could take her away from here, where Jesse Devereaux
can never find her again. She is in my
way, and I want her removed!"</p>

<p>"It would be worth money to you to get her
out of your way," leered granny cunningly:</p>

<p>Roma hesitated a moment, then answered
frankly:</p>

<p>"Yes, but I could not promise to pay you much.
Papa makes me a very small allowance."</p>

<p>The old woman crept nearer to the beautiful,
cruel creature, and gazed up into her face with an
expression of humble adoration, while she murmured
wheedlingly:</p>

<p>"I would take her away from here&mdash;far away&mdash;where
she could never trouble you again, pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
lady, for a reward that even you could afford to
bestow."</p>

<p>"What is that?" cried Roma eagerly, and she
was startled when granny answered nervously:</p>

<p>"A kiss!"</p>

<p>"A kiss!" the girl echoed wonderingly.</p>

<p>Granny was actually trembling with excitement,
and she added pleadingly:</p>

<p>"You are so pretty, Miss Roma, that I have
fallen in love with you, and for my love's sake I
would like to kiss you once. If you grant my
wish, I will be your slave for only one kind look
and kiss!"</p>

<p>She was softened and agitated in a strange
fashion, but she could not help seeing that Roma
recoiled in surprise and disgust.</p>

<p>"Really, this is very strange! I&mdash;I am not
fond of kissing old women. I scarcely ever kiss
even my own mother. I would much rather pay
you a little money!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Granny's face saddened with disappointment,
and she muttered:</p>

<p>"So proud; so very proud! She could not bear
a downfall!"</p>

<p>Roma flushed with annoyance, and added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"You seem so very poor that even a small sum
of money ought to be acceptable to you!"</p>

<p>"I am miserably poor, but I love you&mdash;I would
rather have the kiss."</p>

<p>If Roma had known the old woman's miserly
character she would have been even more surprised
at her fancy. As it was, she hardly knew
what to say. She gazed in disgust at the ugly,
yellow-skinned and wrinkled old hag, and wondered
if she could bring herself to touch that face
with her own fresh, rosy lips.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I would rather give you a hundred dollars
than to kiss you!" she blurted out, in passionate
disgust.</p>

<p>Instantly she saw she had made a grave mistake.
Granny drew back angrily from the
haughty girl, muttering:</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity, what pride! But pride always
goes before a fall!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" flashed Roma.</p>

<p>A moment's silence, and granny answered
cringingly:</p>

<p>"I only meant that you would be humiliated if
that pretty Liane stole Devereaux's heart from
you and married him. The other night I beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Liane for walking with him on the beach by
moonlight!"</p>

<p>"Heavens! It is worse even than I thought!"
cried Roma, springing to her feet, pale with passion.</p>

<p>She advanced toward granny, adding:</p>

<p>"Will you take her away by to-morrow, and
never let him see her face again if I grant your
wish?"</p>

<p>"I swear it, honey!"</p>

<p>"There, then!" and Roma held up her fresh,
rosy lips, shuddering with disgust as the old crone
gave her an affectionate kiss that smacked very
strongly of an old pipe.</p>

<p>"Be sure that you keep your promise!" she
cried, hastening from the house.</p>

<p>Granny watched her until she was out of sight,
clasping her skinny arms across her breast, after
the fashion of one fondling a beloved child.</p>

<p>"How proud, how beautiful!" she kept saying
over to herself in delight. Then she went in and
closed the door, while she sat down to make her
plans for gratifying Roma's wish.</p>

<p>Not a breath of last night's happenings had
reached her, for she seldom held communication
with any one, being feared and hated by the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
community, as much as Liane was loved and
pitied. She knew nothing of the popular beauty
contest, and that Liane had won the prize of a
hundred dollars. If she had known, she would
have managed to get possession of the money ere
now. Liane, having spent the night with Mary
Lang, had gone to her work from there, and was
having an ovation from her girl friends, who put
self aside and rejoiced with her over her triumph.</p>

<p>The proud and happy girl answered gratefully:</p>

<p>"But for your persuasions I should never have
ventured to send in my picture for the contest. I
want to testify my gratitude by giving each of you
five dollars to buy a pretty keepsake."</p>

<p>They protested they would not take a penny of
her little fortune, but the generous girl would not
be denied.</p>

<p>"I have seventy-five dollars left! I am rich
yet!" she cried gayly, for Liane was the happiest
girl in the world to-day.</p>

<p>But it was neither her signal triumph nor the
money that made her happy, it was because she
had seen Jesse Devereaux again, and his radiant,
dark eyes had told her the story of his love as
plain as words.</p>

<p>Though she was grateful to the handsome artist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
for his attentions, she was disappointed because
he had kept Jesse from walking home with her
last night.</p>

<p>But she looked eagerly for some demonstration
from him to-day. Perhaps he would send her
some more flowers, for he had whispered gladly
as they parted:</p>

<p>"Thank you for wearing the roses I sent you!"</p>

<p>Liane's heart leaped with joy at hearing the
flowers had come from Jesse, and she placed them
carefully away that night, determined to keep
them always, for his dear sake.</p>

<p>How her heart sank when Dolly Dorr, who had
been rather quiet and sulky that morning, suddenly
remarked:</p>

<p>"Mr. Devereaux went off, bag and baggage,
they say, to Boston last night, so I suppose that is
the last we shall see of him!"</p>

<p>Liane could not keep from exclaiming regretfully:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>"You seem to be sorry!" Dolly cried significantly.</p>

<p>All eyes turned on Liane, and she blushed rosy
red as she bent lower over the work she was
sewing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Dolly added curtly:</p>

<p>"I did not think you would be so ready to take
away another girl's chance, Liane."</p>

<p>"But he has broken with Miss Clarke. They
quarreled last night," said Lottie Day.</p>

<p>"I did not mean Miss Clarke. I meant myself.
Liane knows he has paid me some attention, and
that I have set my cap at him! I thought she was
my true friend, but I caught her making eyes at
him last night!" Dolly exclaimed ruefully.</p>

<p>The gay girls all laughed at Dolly's jealousy,
but Liane could not say a word for embarrassment,
knowing in her heart how baseless were
Dolly's hopes.</p>

<p>The angry little maiden continued:</p>

<p>"He told me last night that he was free from
Miss Clarke; and I believe I could win him if no
one tried to spoil the sport. I would never have
introduced him to Liane if I had thought she
would try to cut me out."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dolly, you know I have not tried. Could
I help his coming to speak to me last night?" cried
Liane.</p>

<p>"No, but you needn't have encouraged him by
flirting when he spoke to you, blushing and rolling
up your eyes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>A derisive groan went around among the merry
band at Dolly's charge, and Mary Lang spoke up
spiritedly:</p>

<p>"Dolly Dorr, you are simply making yourself
ridiculous, putting in a claim to Mr. Devereaux
because he happened to speak to you once or
twice! Any one with half an eye can see he's in
love with Liane, and I'll state for your benefit that
he told her last night he sent her that bouquet of
roses, and he wanted to walk home with her, only
Mr. Dean was ahead of him!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!" ran the chorus of voices,
Liane drooping her head in blushing confusion,
and Dolly pouting with disappointment, while she
cried spitefully:</p>

<p>"He's nothing but a wretched flirt! He flirted
with Miss Clarke, and then with me, and next
with Liane! I'm glad he got ashamed of himself,
and sneaked off; and I hope he will never come
back!"</p>

<p>Her little fit of temper spoiled the rest of the
day for the girls, and Liane Lester was glad to
get away at six o'clock, where, after a while, she
could be alone with her own thoughts.</p>

<p>But granny was sniveling, with her apron to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
her eyes, when she entered the poverty-stricken
room.</p>

<p>"What is it, granny? Are you ill?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, I have bad news!"</p>

<p>"Bad news?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I've heard from my daughter, your
mother, at last. She's dying down to Boston, and
wants you and me to come," with an artful sob.</p>

<p>"But, of course, we cannot go!" Liane said,
with strange reluctance.</p>

<p>"But, of course, we can. I've got a little money;
enough for the trip. I've just been waiting for
you to come and help me to pack our clothes."</p>

<p>"That will not take long. Our wardrobes are
not extensive. But, I&mdash;I don't want to go!" declared
Liane.</p>

<p>"You unnatural child, not to want to see your
poor dying mother!" snapped the old woman.</p>

<p>"She has been an unnatural mother!" answered
the girl warmly.</p>

<p>"No matter about that! She is my child, and I
want to see her before she dies, and you've got
to go, willy-nilly! So go along with you and get
the tea ready; then we will get packed to go on the
first train!" declared granny, with grim resolution.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A LOVE LETTER.</p>


<p>Liane's little sewing chair was vacant the next
day, and there was grief and surprise among the
five girls present when Miss Bray explained the
reason.</p>

<p>Liane had sent her a little note the night before,
she said, telling her that her grandmother
was taking her to Boston to see a dying relative,
and she did not know when she should be back,
but hoped Miss Bray would have work for her on
her return. She left her dear love for all the girls,
and hoped she should see them soon again.</p>

<p>Every one expressed sorrow but Dolly Dorr,
who from spite and envy had suddenly changed
from a friend to an enemy of Liane.</p>

<p>Dolly tossed her pretty, flaxen head scornfully
and insinuated ugly things about Liane following
Jesse Devereaux to Boston. A dying relative was
a good excuse, but it could not fool Dolly Dorr,
she said significantly.</p>

<p>The other girls took the part of the absent one,
and even Miss Bray gently reproved Dolly for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
slanderous words. The upshot of the matter was
that she grew red and angry, and developed the
rage of a little termagant. Taking offense at Miss
Bray's rebuke, she angrily resigned her position,
tossed her jaunty cap on her fluffy, yellow head,
and flew home.</p>

<p>The ambition to captivate Jesse Devereaux had
quite turned the silly little noddle, and she was
passionately angry at Liane for what she denominated
"her unfair rivalry."</p>

<p>But on reaching home and finding that her father
had just been thrown out of work, Dolly was
a little flustrated at her own precipitancy in leaving
her place, especially as Mrs. Dorr, a weak,
hard-worked woman, bewailed their misfortunes
in copious tears.</p>

<p>"Don't cry like that, mamma, I know of a better
place than Miss Bray's, where I can find work.
Miss Clarke wants a maid," cried Dolly eagerly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dorr's pride rebelled at first from her
pretty daughter going into service like that, but
the notion had quite taken hold of Dolly, and in
the end the worried mother yielded to her persuasions,
especially as the wages were liberal, and
would help them so much in their present strait.</p>

<p>Dolly hurried off to Cliffdene, and asked for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Miss Clarke, offering her services for the vacant
place, as Liane Lester had gone away.</p>

<p>Roma's red-brown eyes flashed with joyful fire
as she cried:</p>

<p>"Where has she gone?"</p>

<p>"Her grandmother took her to Boston to see a
dying relative, miss."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Roma, and her heart leaped
with joy as she realized that granny had kept her
promise to take Liane far away.</p>

<p>"Now I may have some chance of winning Jesse
back again," she thought.</p>

<p>But Dolly's next words threw a damper on her
springing hopes.</p>

<p>"Liane can't fool me with a tale of a dying
relative! I believe she had an understanding with
Jesse Devereaux to follow him down to Boston,"
she exclaimed spitefully.</p>

<p>Roma started violently, her rich color paling
to ashen gray.</p>

<p>"Jesse Devereaux gone!" she cried, in uncontrollable
agitation that betrayed her jealous heart
to Dolly's keen eyes.</p>

<p>The girl thought shrewdly:</p>

<p>"She loves him even if he did tell me he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
not engaged. Whew! won't she hate Liane when
she knows all!"</p>

<p>And, taking advantage of Roma's mood, she
added:</p>

<p>"Liane has been flirting for some time with Mr.
Devereaux, and the night she got the beauty prize
he sent her roses to wear, and voted for her, and
offered to walk home with her that night, only he
was disappointed, because Mr. Malcolm Dean had
asked her first."</p>

<p>Roma, inwardly furious with jealous rage,
tossed her proud head carelessly, and answered:</p>

<p>"Mr. Devereaux cares nothing for the girl!
He is engaged to me, but we had a little tiff, and
he was just flirting with her to pique me because
I would not make up with him just yet!"</p>

<p>Although she regarded Dolly as greatly her inferior,
she was placing herself on a level with her
by these confidences, encouraging Dolly to reply:</p>

<p>"Of course, I know he wouldn't marry Liane,
but she was foolish enough to think so, and I feel
certain she's down to Boston with him now."</p>

<p>Roma knew better, but she only smiled significantly,
giving Dolly the impression that she
agreed with her entirely, and then she said:</p>

<p>"I will agree to give you a week's trial, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
mamma's maid can instruct you as to your duties.
When can you come?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if you wish."</p>

<p>"Very well. I shall expect you," returned
Roma, abruptly ending the interview.</p>

<p>When Dolly was going back the next day, she
stopped in at the post office for her mail, and the
smiling little clerk in the window, as he handed
it out, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Don't Miss Liane Lester work with you at
Miss Bray's, Miss Dolly? There's a letter for
her this morning, the first letter, I believe, that
ever came for her, and now that I come to think
about it, she never calls here for mail, anyhow!"</p>

<p>Dolly's cheeks flushed guiltily, and her heart
gave a strangling thump of surprise, but she said,
quite coolly:</p>

<p>"Yes, Liane works at Miss Bray's with me, and
I'm going down there now, so I'll take her letter,
if you please, and save her the trouble of calling
for it."</p>

<p>The unsuspecting clerk readily handed it out,
and Dolly clutched it with a trembling hand, hurrying
out so as to read the superscription and
gratify her curiosity.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful handwriting! A man's, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and postmarked Boston. Now, it must be Devereaux
or Dean writing to her!" she muttered,
longing to open it, yet not quite daring to commit
the crime.</p>

<p>She placed it at last in her pocket, thinking
curiously:</p>

<p>"As I don't know where Liane is, of course I
cannot forward this letter to her, and&mdash;I would
give anything in the world to know what is in it,
and who wrote it! Perhaps Miss Clarke would
know the writing."</p>

<p>That evening, when she was brushing out the
long tresses of Roma's hair, she ventured on the
subject:</p>

<p>"To-day the postmaster gave me a letter from
Boston to Liane Lester, but I don't know where to
send it, and I am wondering who wrote it!"</p>

<p>She felt Roma give a quick start as she cried:</p>

<p>"Let me see it!"</p>

<p>Dolly giggled, and brought it out of her pocket.</p>

<p>"Oh! It is Mr. Devereaux's writing," cried
Roma excitedly.</p>

<p>"So I thought, miss. Now I wonder what he
wrote to her about? I must be mistaken thinking
he knew she had gone to Boston," cried Dolly.</p>

<p>Roma turned the letter over and over in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
hand, her eyes blazing, her cheeks crimson, her
heart throbbing with jealous rage.</p>

<p>How dared he write to Liane? How dared he
forget her, Roma, so insolently, and so soon? She
would have liked to see them both stretched dead
at her feet!</p>

<p>They looked guiltily at each other, the mistress
and maid, one thought in either mind. Dare they
open the letter?</p>

<p>Dolly twittered:</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you would allow him to write
to her! He belongs to you!"</p>

<p>She felt like making common cause with Roma
against Liane, in her bitter envy forgetting how
often she had inveighed against Roma's pride and
cruelty. She continued artfully:</p>

<p>"The letter can never do her any good, because
we don't know where to send it. And&mdash;and
would it be any harm for us to take a peep at it?"</p>

<p>"I think I have a right," Roma answered, her
bosom heaving stormily, then she clutched Dolly's
arm:</p>

<p>"Girl, girl, if we do this thing&mdash;you and I&mdash;will
you swear never to betray me?" she breathed
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I swear!" Dolly muttered fiercely, in her anger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
at Liane, and then Roma's impatience burst all
bounds. She quickly broke the seal of the letter,
her angry eyes running over the scented sheets,
while Dolly coolly read it over her shoulder.</p>

<p>And if ever two cruel hearts were punished for
their curiosity, they were Roma's, the mistress,
and Dolly's, the maid.</p>

<p>It was an impassioned love letter that Devereaux
had written to Liane, and it ended with the
offer of his hand, as she already possessed his
heart.</p>

<p>The young lover had chosen the sweetest words
and phrases to declare his passion, and he explained
everything that she might have misunderstood.</p>

<p>He had fallen in love with her at first sight, but
he was bound by a promise to one he no longer
even admired. In honor he could not speak to
Liane, but his betrothed had herself broken the
fetters that bound him, and he was free now to
woo his darling. He had intended to tell her so
that night of the beauty contest, but Malcolm
Dean had rivaled him. Then had come the summons
to his sick father, tearing him away from
Stonecliff. He must remain some time in Boston
with his sinking father, and his impatience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
prompted this letter. Would Liane correspond
with him? Would she be his beloved wife, the
treasure of his heart and home? He should wait
with burning impatience for her reply.</p>

<p>Roma threw the letter on the floor and stamped
on it with her angry foot.</p>

<p>Not in such tender, passionate phrases had he
wooed her when she promised him her hand, but
in light, airy words, born of the flirtation through
which she had successfully steered him to a proposal
so quickly regretted, so gladly taken back.
Oh, how she loved and hated him in a breath!</p>

<p>As for the girl, thank Heaven, granny had
promised to keep her out of the way. Ay, even
to kill her, if she commanded it. It was strange
how the old woman had fallen so slavishly under
her sway, but she was thankful for it, though she
shuddered still with disgust at remembrance of
granny's fond caress.</p>

<p>She said to herself that it were better for Liane
Lester that she never had been born than to cross
her path again, and to take from her the love of
the man she had worked so hard to win, and then
so rashly lost.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A CRUEL FORGERY.</p>


<p>At the elegant family mansion on Boston's most
aristocratic avenue, Jesse Devereaux, watching
by the bedside of his sick father, waited with
burning impatience for the answer to the letter in
which he had poured out the overwhelming tenderness
of his soul.</p>

<p>No shadow of doubt clouded his love, he felt so
sure of Liane's love in return. Had it not trembled
in her voice, gleamed in her eyes, and blushed
on her cheeks?</p>

<p>Oh, they would be so happy together, he and his
young bride, Liane! He would make up to her
for all the poverty and sorrow of her past life.
Life should be flower-strewn and love-sweet for
her now.</p>

<p>Of course he expected some opposition from
Lyde, his proud, fashionable sister, when she
learned that he was off with his engagement to the
heiress, Miss Clarke, and meant to wed a poor
girl, who worked for her living. But he meant to
stand firm, and when she saw how sweet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
beautiful Liane was, she would be ready to excuse
him and accept his darling for a sister.</p>

<p>In these rosy daydreams the hours flew, and on
the second day after posting his letter he received
a reply.</p>

<p>It gave him something of an unpleasant shock
when he held the square blue envelope in his hand
and read the ill-written address:</p>

<p>
MISTER JESS DEVEROW,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No. &mdash; Comonwelt Avnoo,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bostin,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Mass.</span><br />
</p>

<p>His cheek flushed, and he sighed.</p>

<p>"Poor girl, of course she has had no opportunities
of education, but she can have private teachers,
and soon remedy all that."</p>

<p>And he opened the letter with the eagerness of
a lover, despite the slight damper on his spirits,
caused by his love's bad chirography, united to
even worse orthography.</p>

<p>His eager eyes traveled quickly over the small
sheet with the awkward sentences of one little
used to epistolary work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Stonecliff</span>, the 17 Sept.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deer Mister Devrow</span>: Deer me, what a s'hpise your
letter wuz! I thought you wuz jest flirtin' with me! I
had heerd what a flirt you wuz, so I jest tryed my hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
on you! They told me you wuz ingage to the beautiful
Miss Clarke, and I thought what fun to cut her out!</p>

<p>But I didn't think I could do it. I didn' know as I was
so pretty till I tuk the beauty prize that nite. Deer me,
how glad I wuz of that money! I'm a grate heiress now,
like Miss Clarke, ain't I?</p>

<p>I'm much obleedge fur your offer to marry, but I can't
see my way clear to accept, being as I don't love you well
enuff. I never did admire these dark men with sassy,
black eyes and dark hair. I've heern tell they are as jealous
as a turk. I make bold to say, I think Mr. Deen is
the style I most admire&mdash;deep blue eyes and brown curls.
He seems to have took a fancy to me, too, and if he
should ast me the question you did, I know I could say
yes. Forgive if this pains, but it's best to be frank, so
you won't go on loving me in vane.</p>

<p>I'm grateful to you for your vote that helped to git me
that hundred dollars! I'm goin' down to Bostin to see
the sites, and buy me a red silk gown, I always wuz crazy
for one!</p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Truly yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Liane Lester</span>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Devereaux sat like one dazed, going over and
over the letter of rejection. He could hardly realize
that Liane's little hand had penned those
words.</p>

<p>No more cruel blow at a strong man's love and
pride had ever been dealt than that letter, showing
the writer to be possessed of so shallow a nature
as to be incapable of appreciating the treasure
of a true heart's love, so ungratefully thrown
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesse Devereaux thrust it away from him at
last, and sat staring blankly before him with
heavy eyes, like one contemplating the ruins of
his dearest hope.</p>

<p>It seemed to him as if he had just laid some
dearly loved one in the grave. Hours and days of
sorrow seemed to pass over him as he sat there
brooding darkly over his fate.</p>

<p>Was it indeed but an hour ago he had felt so
hopeful and glad, telling himself he had just
found the sweetest joy of life in the dawn of love?</p>

<p>What foolish thoughts, what a misplaced love,
what rash confidence in an innocent face and demure,
pansy-blue eyes!</p>

<p>She had just been flirting with him because she
heard he was a great flirt, and was engaged to
Miss Clarke, and she wanted to see if she could
"cut her out." It was all heartless vanity that he
had taken for shy, bashful love. The ignorant little
working girl had proved herself an adept in the
art of flirtation.</p>

<p>It was a crushing blow, and his heart was very
sore. He had loved her so, ever since the night
they had first met, loved her with the passion of
his life! Even now the memory of her sweetness
would not down. He would be haunted forever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
by her voice, her glance, her smile, so alluring in
their beauty, so false in true womanly worth and
grace, will-o'-the-wisp lights, shining but to betray.</p>

<p>And Malcolm Dean was his rival in the heart of
the lovely, coquettish working girl! She admired
his "deep-blue eyes and brown curls" as much as
she disliked "sassy black eyes and dark hair." She
would marry him if he asked her, she said. Jesse
wondered cynically if Dean had been merely
flirting, too, or would his love prompt him to elevate
pretty Liane to the proud position of his
bride.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Liane, innocent as an angel, of
course, of the letter that Roma had sent in her
name, had duly arrived in the city.</p>

<p>Her grandmother had taken her to cheap lodgings
that night, and, after they had been shown
to a room, the old woman said abruptly:</p>

<p>"Now I'll go and inquire about my daughter."</p>

<p>Liane went to the window and looked out in
awe at the lights of the great city, wondering how
far away from this spot Jesse Devereaux could
be to-night. Her young heart throbbed with joy
at the thought of his nearness, for she had no realization
of the extent of Boston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>While she was musing and wondering granny
returned, saying crossly:</p>

<p>"It seems I made a mistake in the address. She
ain't here at all, but I'm tired, and not a step shall
I stir from this to-night, so we'll go to bed, Liane,
and I'll hunt her in the morning."</p>

<p>"But if she should die before morning,
granny?"</p>

<p>"Let her die, then; I can't help it! Go to bed!"
snarled the old woman, creeping into bed; so
Liane, seeing the uselessness of remonstrance,
followed her example.</p>

<p>The next morning, after breakfast, granny announced
that she would leave Liane in care of the
landlady, while she went out in search of the dying
daughter.</p>

<p>"Let me go with you," pleaded the girl, with a
vague hope of meeting Devereaux somewhere on
the street, all her thought clinging to him with
tender persistence.</p>

<p>"No, I won't have you along with me, but I'll
come back for you as soon as I find her," snapped
granny, so sharply that Liane gave in and
watched her depart with keen regret.</p>

<p>"I should have liked to go with her to see some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
of the sights of the great city," she sighed, so forlornly
that the landlady said cheerily:</p>

<p>"Well, come in here and sit a while with my sick
sister, and I'll hurry up my morning's work and
go out with you myself this afternoon."</p>

<p>Lizzie White was a pretty shop girl, just recovering
from a spell of fever, and she took an
instant interest in the pretty new boarder.</p>

<p>"Sister Annie can show you all over the city,"
she said. "But," hesitatingly, "haven't you any
other clothes to wear?" her glance falling deprecatingly
on Liane's simple dark-blue print gown
and summer straw hat. "It's time for fall things,
you know," she added.</p>

<p>Liane blushed at the poverty of her attire, but
answered gently:</p>

<p>"These are the best clothes I have, but I have a
little money of my own, and if I knew where to go,
I would buy a blue serge suit."</p>

<p>"Sister Annie can take you to a place this afternoon&mdash;the
very store where I work when I am
well," replied Lizzie encouragingly.</p>

<p>Afternoon came, but no granny yet, and Mrs.
Brinkley offered to take Liane out, saying it was
such a pity to stay indoors all day when the sun
shone so bright and warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Liane accepted eagerly, and then her new
friend, Lizzie, shyly proffered her a new fall suit
of her own to wear.</p>

<p>"Do wear it to please me, and because people
will make remarks on your print gown," she said
eagerly, and the girl, fearful that Mrs. Brinkley
might be ashamed of her shabby attire, accepted
gratefully.</p>

<p>Her appearance was indeed quite different
when clothed in Lizzie's brown cloth skirt, scarlet
silk waist, and jaunty brown jacket, with a brown
walking skirt to match.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">LIANE'S FLEETING LOVE DREAM.</p>


<p>Liane was enchanted with the beautiful city,
and Mrs. Brinkley, who felt a proud proprietorship
in it, was delighted with her praises.</p>

<p>They went from one grand building to another,
but the good woman soon noticed that Liane
seemed best pleased walking along the crowded
streets, and that instead of observing all that she
pointed out, the girl's eyes wandered wistfully
from one face to another, as if in search of some
one.</p>

<p>"Are you looking for your grandmother?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, ma'am," and Liane blushed like a rose.</p>

<p>"Then it must be your beau, you look so bashful.
Have you got a beau in Boston?"</p>

<p>Liane shook her pretty head, but she looked so
conscious that the woman plied her with curious
questions, until the young girl owned that she
knew one person in Boston, a young man, who
had spent several weeks at Stonecliff. Then the
curious matron did not rest until she had learned
his name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jesse Devereaux! Was he handsome as a picture,
with big, rolling, black eyes? Yes? Why,
my pretty dear, you must not set your heart on
him. He is one of the young millionaires up on
Commonwealth Avenue, the swellest young man
in Boston. He would never stoop to a poor working
girl."</p>

<p>She saw the beautiful color fade from the girl's
rosy cheek, and her bosom heaved with emotion as
she faltered:</p>

<p>"He was very kind to me at Stonecliff!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Brinkley knew the world so well that she
took instant alarm, exclaiming warningly:</p>

<p>"Don't you set any store by his kindness, child.
No good comes of rich young men showing attentions
to pretty working girls. If you have followed
him here through a fancy for his handsome
face, then you had better go home to-night."</p>

<p>Eagerly, blushingly, Liane disclaimed such a
purpose, saying granny had brought her to see a
relative.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I only thought I might see his face in some
of the crowded streets," she faltered.</p>

<p>"It is better for you never to see his face again,
for it's plain to be seen he has stolen your heart,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
chided the widow. "Come, I'll show you his
grand home, and then you may understand better
how much he is above you, and how useless it is
to hope to catch him."</p>

<p>Liane's cheeks burned at the chidings of the
good woman, and tears leaped to her eyes, but she
did not refuse the proffer of seeing Devereaux's
home. She thought eagerly:</p>

<p>"I might see him at the window, or perhaps
coming down the steps into the street. Then, if
he should come and speak to me joyfully, as he did
that night at the beauty contest, I believe even
this good, anxious woman could see that he loves
me."</p>

<p>She walked along happily by Mrs. Brinkley's
side, carrying the jaunty brown jacket on her
arm, as Lizzie had advised, for the sun's rays
were warm, and she was weary from her sightseeing.
The scarlet silk waist looked very gay,
but if she had dreamed of the dreadful letter that
had told Devereaux she was coming to Boston
to buy a red silk gown, she would have torn it off
and trampled it beneath her feet.</p>

<p>Her beautiful eyes sparkled with pleasure at
sight of the splendid homes of Boston's wealthy
class, and she could not help exclaiming:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am not envious, but I would like to be rich
and live in one of these palaces."</p>

<p>"That you can never do, child, so don't think
about it any more, as I tell Lizzie, when she gets
to sighing for riches," rejoined the prudent
matron. "Look, now, at that grand house we're
coming to; Mr. Devereaux lives there with his old
father and his young married sister, the proudest
beauty in Boston. You see, I read all about them
in the society columns, and&mdash;oh!"</p>

<p>She paused with a stifled shriek, for the great
front door of the grand mansion had indeed
opened, as Liane secretly prayed it would, and a
man came down the steps&mdash;Jesse Devereaux himself!</p>

<p>Leaving Lyde beside his father's bed, he was
going out for a walk to try to shake off the benumbing
influences of the letter that had shattered
his air castles into hopeless ruins.</p>

<p>It seemed to him as if his thoughts had taken
bodily shape, as he beheld Liane there in reach of
his hand, her timid, eager glance lifted almost appealingly
to his face.</p>

<p>He hesitated, he almost stopped to speak to her,
so thrilled was he by the sight of her lovely face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
again, but his eyes fell on the gay red silk waist,
and the words of her letter recurred to his mind:</p>

<p>"I'm coming down to Bostin to see the sites,
and buy a red silk gown. I've always been crazy
for one."</p>

<p>She was here, she had the red silk gown she
craved, and idle curiosity had led her to pass his
house, perhaps boasting to her companion, meanwhile,
that she had flirted with the owner and refused
his hand.</p>

<p>A deep crimson rose to his brow, and his heart
almost stopped its beating with wounded love and
pride. Just glancing at Liane with cold, indifferent
eyes, he lifted his hat, bowed stiffly, and
passed her by in scorn.</p>

<p>The girl, who had almost stopped to speak to
him, gave a sigh that was almost a sob, and
dropped her eyes, moving on by Mrs. Brinkley's
side with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>"That was he, Jesse Devereaux himself," whispered
the latter excitedly. "My, what a cold,
haughty stare and bow; enough to freeze you.
You see how 'tis, my dear? When city folks visit
the country they're mighty gracious, but when
country folks come to the city, they don't hardly
recognize 'em."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Liane's pale smile at Mrs. Brinkley's observation
was sadder than the wildest outburst of tears.</p>

<p>"I see that you are right," she answered, with
gentle humility that touched her new friend's
heart, and made her exclaim:</p>

<p>"Don't never give him another thought, honey.
He ain't worth it. You're sweet enough and
pretty enough to marry the proudest in the land,
but nothing don't count now but money."</p>

<p>They hurried home to the poor lodgings, so different
from the splendid locality they had just
left, and found granny just returned from her
search and in rather a good humor from the day's
outing.</p>

<p>She did not scold Liane for going out, as the
girl expected, but said calmly:</p>

<p>"I was too late. I found Cora dead and the
funeral just starting, so I went with it, and saw
her laid away in her last home. Then I thought I
had just as well finish the day looking over the
things she left, but I wasn't any better off by it,
for the people where she boarded took it all for
debt."</p>

<p>She was lying straight along, but, of course,
Liane did not know it, and she tried to feel a little
sorrow for the unknown mother laid in her lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
grave to-day, but the emotion was very faint. She
could not grieve much for one she had never seen,
and of whom granny had given such a frankly
bad report.</p>

<p>Her first thought was that now she could go
back to Stonecliff, away from the city that had
held Jesse Devereaux, whose proud glance and
chilling bow had stabbed her heart with such cruel
pain.</p>

<p>But on making this request, the old woman
scowled in disapproval.</p>

<p>"Back to Stonecliff? No, indeed!" she cried.
"I hate the place, and I left it for good when we
came away. You can get a place to work in Boston,
and we will stay here."</p>

<p>"Yes, it will be easy to get in as a salesgirl at
the store where I work. I'll recommend you,"
said the sick girl kindly.</p>

<p>Liane knew there was no appeal from granny's
decision, and, after thanking Lizzie for the loan
of her gown and hat, she returned to the shabby
little room, longing to seek solitude in her grief.</p>

<p>But granny soon entered, carrying a bundle,
and exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brinkley says you bought this dress to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and paid for it, too! Now, where'd the
money come from, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>Liane had to confess the truth about the beauty
contest, and, as soon as the old woman took it in,
she cried furiously:</p>

<p>"And you dared to spend that money for finery,
you vain hussy?"</p>

<p>"It was my own, granny," Liane answered.</p>

<p>"Where is the rest of it? Give me every penny
that is left, before I beat you black and blue!"
raged the old termagant.</p>

<p>"Granny, you promised never to beat me again
if I would stay and work for you in your old age,"
reminded Liane.</p>

<p>"I don't care what I promised! Give me the
rest of the money before I kill you!" hissed the
savage creature, clutching Liane's arm so tight
that she sobbed with pain.</p>

<p>"Let go, or I'll call for help!"</p>

<p>"Dare to do it, and I'll choke you before any one
comes!" winding her skinny claws about the fair
white throat.</p>

<p>Liane felt as if her last hour had come, and she
was so unhappy she did not greatly care, but she
struggled with the old harpy, and succeeded in
throwing her off, while she said rebelliously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will never give you the money while I live,
and if you kill me to get it, it will do you no good.
You will be hanged for my murder."</p>

<p>Perhaps granny saw the force of this reasoning,
for she desisted from her brutality, whining:</p>

<p>"I'm so poor, so miserably poor, that you ought
to give me every penny you get."</p>

<p>"And dress in rags!" cried the girl indignantly.
"No, granny, I will never do it again, and if you
illtreat me any more, I will run away from you,
and then you will starve."</p>

<p>She knew she would never have the heart to
carry out her threat, but she had found out that
she could intimidate the old woman by the threat
of leaving, so she put on a bold air, and continued:</p>

<p>"Here is five dollars for a present, and it is all
you will get of that money. I gave away twenty-five
dollars in keepsakes to my girl friends before
I left Stonecliff, and I have spent thirty dollars
for some decent clothes to wear. Now, I have
given you five dollars, and I have but forty left,
and I shall keep that for myself, in case I have
to run away from you and hide myself from your
brutality."</p>

<p>Granny snatched eagerly at the money, muttering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
maledictions on the girl for her extravagance,
but Liane, sitting with downcast eyes, pretended
not to take any notice of her, until the old woman,
glaring at her in wonder at the beauty that could
win such a prize, demanded harshly:</p>

<p>"Was Miss Clarke's picture in that contest?"</p>

<p>When Liane answered in the affirmative, she
was startled at the woman's anger.</p>

<p>"You dared to take that prize over beautiful
Roma's head&mdash;you?" she cried furiously.</p>

<p>"I did not take it. The judges gave it to me.
The contest was open to any pretty girl, rich or
poor," Liane answered gently.</p>

<p>Granny looked as if she could spring upon the
girl and rend her limb from limb, so bitter was
her rage. She moved about the room, clinching
her hands in fury, whispering maledictions to herself,
but again Liane forgot to notice her, she was
so absorbed in her own troubles.</p>

<p>She had dreamed a fleeting dream of love and
bliss, and the awakening was cruel!</p>

<p>"I have been vain, foolish, to dream he loved
me because he sent me a few roses and offered to
walk home with me that night. He was only
amusing himself," she thought, shrinking in pain
from the cruel truth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WHAT DOLLY TOLD.</p>


<p>Seven weeks slipped uneventfully away.</p>

<p>The bright, cool days of October gave place to
dreary, drizzly, bleak November.</p>

<p>Liane had become absorbed into Boston's great
army of busy working girls. Lizzie White had
secured her a position at a glove counter in the
same store with herself, and granny had rented
two cheap rooms in Mrs. Brinkley's house, and
gone to housekeeping.</p>

<p>Her resentment against Liane continued unabated,
and she never gave the girl a kind word,
but she refrained from acts of violence, lest her
meek slave should rebel and leave her alone, in her
old age and poverty, to fight the battle of a useless
existence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Judge Devereaux had died and been
buried with the pomp and ceremony befitting his
wealth and position, and his son and daughter
had inherited his millions.</p>

<p>Roma Clarke did not fail to send a letter of the
sweetest sympathy to her former lover&mdash;a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
that in writing and expression was so far different
from Liane's letter that he could not fail to
note the difference.</p>

<p>"Poor Liane! What a pity her mind is not as
cultured as her lovely face!" he thought, with a
bitter pang.</p>

<p>Since the day of their meeting on the avenue,
he had not seen Liane, and he supposed she had
seen the sights of the city, bought some garish
finery, and returned to the wretched hovel she
called her home.</p>

<p>He despised her for her shallow coquetry, but
he could not help pitying her poverty, and the
wretched life with the old hag, from whose brutal
violence he had once rescued her at the cost of a
broken arm.</p>

<p>"How gladly I would have taken her from her
wretched lot to a life of love and luxury, but she
preferred Dean. I wonder if he has justified her
hopes?" he thought bitterly.</p>

<p>He grew more and more curious on the subject
after his father's burial, in the quiet that comes
to a house of mourning, and he suddenly resolved
to return to Stonecliff and find out for himself.</p>

<p>The little seaside town looked very gloomy in
the downpour of a cold November rain, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
boom of the sea, lashed to fury in a storm, was
disquieting to his nerves, but he sallied forth to
the post office, and stood on the steps, watching
to see Liane passing by on her way from work,
as on the first day he had seen her lovely face.</p>

<p>How freshly it all came back to him, that day
but two months ago, when he had followed her
to restore her truant veil, and first looked into
the luring blue eyes that had thrilled his heart
with passion.</p>

<p>What a mighty passion for the shallow coquette
had been born in his heart at that meeting&mdash;passion
followed by pain! Ah, how he wished now
that he had never met her, that he had let the blue
veil blow away on the heedless wind! The little
acts of kindness had brought him a harvest of
pain.</p>

<p>Even now, despite all, he was waiting and
watching with painful yearning for another sight
of her face.</p>

<p>But the moments waned, and she came not.</p>

<p>He saw the other work people of the town going
home through the falling dusk. Four of Miss
Bray's girls dropped in at the post office, flashing
surprised glances at his handsome, familiar face,
wondering at his return; then they went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
again, and he thought that presently Liane and
Dolly would be passing also.</p>

<p>But he was disappointed, and presently he realized
that it was useless waiting longer.</p>

<p>"Dean must have married her and taken her off
already, but it must have been a very quiet affair.
I have seen nothing of his marriage in the papers,"
he thought with strange disquiet, as he
came down the steps.</p>

<p>A handsome carriage, with prancing gray
horses, in a silver-mounted harness, with liveried
footman, suddenly drew up at the curbstone, and
a brilliant face flushed on him from the window.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jesse, what a surprise! How do you do?
Won't you look in our box and bring me out my
mail?" cried Roma Clarke gushingly.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but obedience. Jesse
came out to her with two letters and a paper, and
as she took them, she threw open the carriage
door, urging sweetly:</p>

<p>"Come home with me, do, and see papa and
mamma. They will be so glad to see you. Poor
papa has been ill of a fever, and is just convalescing."</p>

<p>He was in a reckless mood. He accepted the
invitation and went home with her, but she did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
not find him a very congenial companion. He ignored
her coquettish attempts to return to their
old footing.</p>

<p>"You hate me yet," she pouted.</p>

<p>"Not at all. I am glad to be your friend, if you
will permit me," he replied courteously.</p>

<p>"Friend!" Roma cried, in an indescribable tone.</p>

<p>He ignored the reproach, and said calmly:</p>

<p>"Tell me all that has happened since I went back
to Boston. Who are married and who are dead?"</p>

<p>"No one that you know," replied Roma, and she
never guessed what a thrill of joy the words sent
to his heart.</p>

<p>He was glad. He could not help it, that Malcolm
Dean had not married Liane yet. He was
yearning for news of her, yet he knew better than
to ask Roma for it. He knew it would only make
her angry and jealous.</p>

<p>While he was alone in the drawing room, Roma
having gone to apprise her parents of his arrival,
he was startled to see Dolly Dorr sidle in, dressed
in a dark-gray gown, with a maid's white cap and
apron.</p>

<p>He arose in surprise.</p>

<p>"Miss Dorr! Is it possible?"</p>

<p>Dolly colored and hung her head, muttering:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're surprised to see me here as Miss
Clarke's maid."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied frankly; then a sudden
thought came to him, and he added: "And your
pretty friend, Miss Lester? Is she at Cliffdene
also?"</p>

<p>Dolly tossed her head scornfully.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, she is not here!"</p>

<p>"Where, then?" he asked eagerly, with a painful
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" cried Dolly pertly, with
her flaxen head on one side, like a bird, and he
answered quickly:</p>

<p>"Of course not!"</p>

<p>Dolly smoothed down her white apron with her
little hands, and, glancing at him sidewise with
her bright blue eyes, returned indignantly:</p>

<p>"Then, if you don't know, I can tell you. I used
to like Liane, but I despise her now. That beauty
prize made a fool of the girl, and turned her so
silly no one liked her any more. She spent all that
money for gaudy clothes and cheap jewelry, trying
to entrap that artist, Mr. Dean. She was
crazy about him, and didn't mind everybody
knowing it, either. So at last she went chasing off
to some city after him, and I don't know what became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
of her then, and I don't care, for every one
says she must have gone straight to the bad."</p>

<p>She studied his paling cheek with keen eyes for
a moment, then added:</p>

<p>"But I almost forgot. Mr. Clarke sent me to
show you up to his room."</p>

<p>Devereaux rose silently, and followed the pert
maid upstairs.</p>

<p>It never occurred to Devereaux to doubt Dolly's
story in the least. He believed her a simple,
truthful, shallow little maiden devoid of guile.</p>

<p>The little actress had played her part well, and
Roma, listening behind a curtain, was delighted
with the skill of her pupil, so hastily schooled a
moment before in her artful story.</p>

<p>With a heavy heart Devereaux followed the
scheming maid upstairs to Mr. Clarke's apartment,
where he met a joyful welcome.</p>

<p>"Ah, my boy, I have been ill for many weeks.
It seems an age since we parted that night at the
Beauty Show," he exclaimed, as he wrung Devereaux's
hand, adding sadly: "The strangest
thing of all is the disappearance of the successful
contestant for the prize. She went away a day
or two afterward, and no one has the least knowledge
of her whereabouts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>This was confirmation of Dolly's artful story,
and Devereaux felt a strange choking in his
throat that kept him silent, while Mr. Clarke continued
eagerly:</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, I was deeply interested in
the beautiful Miss Lester, and felt a hearty sympathy
for her troubles. She led a sad existence
with that wicked old grandmother, and I was on
the point of asking her to come and stay at Cliffdene
as my typewriter, just to give her a better
home, you know, poor girl, when she disappeared
so strangely, going away, some people insinuate,
to lead a gayer life," sighing.</p>

<p>Devereaux knew quite well, from the letter he
had received from her, that Liane could scarcely
have filled the position of Mr. Clarke's typewriter,
but he was too generous to say so. He swallowed
the lump in his throat as best he could, and answered:</p>

<p>"I hope the insinuations are not true, but I cannot
tell. I saw Miss Lester once in Boston. It
was a few days after the contest, and she was
walking past my home with a respectable-looking,
middle-aged woman. I have never seen her
since."</p>

<p>"So it was to Boston she went? I wish I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
find the poor girl! I would try to interest my wife
in her fate," exclaimed Mr. Clarke, but that lady,
entering at the moment, overheard the words, and
frowned angrily.</p>

<p>"I will have nothing to do with the girl, and the
interest you take in her is very displeasing to me,"
she said curtly.</p>

<p>Roma had worked busily, fostering jealousy in
her mind until she almost hated the name of Liane
Lester.</p>

<p>She shook hands with Devereaux, welcomed
him cordially, and returned to the subject.</p>

<p>"Speaking of that girl," she said, "I feel that
sympathy is wasted on such as Liane Lester. At
one time Roma and I were both so moved with
pity for her poverty that we offered her the position
of Roma's maid, with a good salary and a
comfortable home, but the old woman and the girl
both refused, as if they had actually been insulted,
though Dolly Dorr, who worked with Liane, was
glad enough to apply for the position Liane refused,
and fills it very acceptably to Roma. After
that we took no further interest in the girl, and
rumor says that her head was quite turned by vanity
after getting the beauty prize, so that she and
the old granny moved away from Stonecliff."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke had pitied and admired Liane until
her rivalry with Roma, and the latter's specious
tales had turned the scales against her, and made
her jealous of her husband's interest in the lovely
girl, so she said again, with flashing eyes and
heightened color:</p>

<p>"I do not approve of Mr. Clarke's strong interest
in the girl, and would certainly never consent
to receive her beneath the roof of Cliffdene."</p>

<p>She did not understand the strange glance of
blended reproach and pity her husband bent upon
her as he thought:</p>

<p>"My poor, deceived love, I cannot be angry with
her, for she does not understand the painful interest
I take in this Liane Lester, foreboding that she
may possibly be our own child, doomed to poverty
and woe, while her place in our homes and hearts
is usurped by an upstart and an ingrate, without
one lovable trait, but whom my poor wife feels
compelled to blindly worship, believing her her
own child! Ah, how unfortunate this illness that
has prevented my tracing Nurse Jenks' history!"</p>

<p>Happily unconscious of her father's unfavorable
opinion, Roma entered and seated herself close
to his chair, displaying an unwonted tenderness
for him that deceived no one but Devereaux, for
whose benefit it was designed. Both her parents
knew that Roma was never affectionate, except
to gain some end of her own.</p>

<p>On this occasion she was unwontedly sweet and
gentle, with a new pensiveness in her manner
more attractive to Devereaux than her usual brilliancy.
She made no bids for his attention; she
seemed sadly resigned to her fate, as her downcast
eyes and stifled sighs attested. It touched
him, but he felt too sad at heart to console others,
and he soon tore himself away, returning that
night to Boston, wondering if it could be possible,
that the same city had held Liane all this time that
he had supposed her safe at Stonecliff.</p>

<p>He knew that Malcolm Dean was in Philadelphia,
and had been there for some time, and
he wondered if the artist's love for Liane had
failed to realize her confident hopes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor little thing! I pity her, with her sweet
love dream blighted!" he thought generously, as
he awakened early the next morning, pursuing the
same sad train of thought.</p>

<p>A startling surprise awaited him after breakfast,
where Lyde was sitting going over the new
magazines.</p>

<p>Her dark eyes brightened suddenly, as she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Jesse, the beautiful face on
the outside cover of this magazine resembles perfectly
the pretty girl from whom I buy my
gloves!"</p>

<p>"Really!" he exclaimed, taking the magazine,
and flushing and paling alternately, as he saw before
him the cover that Dean had designed, with
Liane's face for the central figure.</p>

<p>How beautiful it was? How beautiful! His
heart leaped madly, then sank again in his breast.</p>

<p>"Do you think it can be accidental, or is it really
her portrait? She is lovely, Jesse, with a natural,
high-bred air, the darkest eyes, like purple
pansies rimmed in jet, and the most beautiful
chestnut hair, all touched with gleams of gold.
I have woven quite a romance round her, fancying
her some rich girl reduced to poverty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>His heart was beating with muffled throbs, his
eyes flashed with eagerness, but he asked with
seeming carelessness:</p>

<p>"What is her name?"</p>

<p>He was not in the least surprised when she answered:</p>

<p>"Miss Lester, and the other girls call her Liane.
It is a pretty name, and, oddly enough, I read it
once in a novel. She must have been named from
it; don't you think, Jesse?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so."</p>

<p>He could hardly speak, he was so excited, and
Lyde rambled on:</p>

<p>"We have fallen in love with each other, pretty
Liane and I. She always hurries to meet me and
show me her gloves. Her eyes smile at me so tenderly,
as if she were really fond of me, and I almost
believe she is, for when I allow her to try on
my gloves for me, she has such a caressing way,
I almost long to kiss her. But then, perhaps, she
has the same manner with all, just to get trade,"
disappointedly.</p>

<p>Devereaux recalled the caressing touch of her
lips on his hand that night by the sea; her pretty,
bashful gratitude, and groaned within himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, my lost love, my false love!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Aloud he said cynically:</p>

<p>"I thought you were too proud, Lyde, to notice
a pretty salesgirl."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jesse, I like to be kind to them all, poor
things! And they appreciate a kind word and
smile more than you might think. And many of
these girls are so very pretty, too, that really, if
I were looking for beauty, I believe I should seek
it among the working girls in our stores. This
Liane Lester, too, is lovelier than all the rest, and
her voice so soft and sweet that, really, I am sure
she must be a reduced aristocrat."</p>

<p>He wondered if he dare tell her the truth about
Liane, the story of his love. Smilingly he said:</p>

<p>"You will have me falling in love with your
pretty glove girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, not for the world!" she cried, in dismay.
"My dear Jesse, never think of loving and marrying
out of your own set. One can admire beauty
in a poor girl as one admires beauty in a statue,
but, lifted above her station, my pretty Liane
would not be half so admirable."</p>

<p>"Of course not," he replied cynically, and decided
not to make her his confidante.</p>

<p>All the same, he determined to see for himself
again the lovely face that had won Lyde's admiration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
He knew where she bought her gloves, and
that afternoon he was close by when the little
army of salesgirls came pouring out into the
street.</p>

<p>By and by came two arm in arm, Lizzie White
and Liane, and his eyes feasted again on the
lovely face beneath the little blue hat, noting with
gladness its purity of expression.</p>

<p>"They lied. She is pure and innocent still, in
spite of pardonable vanity and girlish coquetry,"
he thought, with a subtle thrill of joy.</p>

<p>Then he saw Granny Jenks dart forward with
a skinny, outstretched claw, whining:</p>

<p>"I came for your wages, Liane. I was afraid
you might fool away the money before you got
home."</p>

<p>"The old harpy!" he muttered, with irrepressible
indignation, as he saw her clutch the money
Liane had earned by her week's toil.</p>

<p>Then he drew back quickly, lest she should see
him, a sudden resolve forming in his mind.</p>

<p>He would follow them, and find out where her
home was, and if she deserved the cruel things
they said of her at Stonecliff. He felt sure that
she had been slandered, poor, pretty Liane, leading
her simple, blameless life of toil and poverty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>He thought with pleasure of Mr. Clarke's interest
in Liane, and promised himself to write to
that gentleman all he could find out about her,
little dreaming of the cruel consequences that
would follow on the writing of the letter.</p>

<p>"Poor little girl, it is a shame that evil hearts
should malign and traduce her, living her humble
life of toil, poverty, and innocence!" Jesse Devereaux
said to himself pityingly, on returning
from following Liane to her humble abode.</p>

<p>He satisfied himself that her surroundings,
though poor, were strictly respectable, and that
she earned a meager living for herself and granny
by patient, daily toil, and he had turned back to
his own life of ease and luxury with a sore heart.</p>

<p>Keen sympathy and pity drove resentment from
his mind, effacing all but divine tenderness.</p>

<p>He longed for an intensity that was almost pain
to brighten her daily life, so weary, toilsome, and
devoid of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Had she but loved me, beautiful, hapless
Liane, how different her lot in life would have
been!" he thought, picturing her as the queen of
his splendid home, her graceful form clothed in
rich attire, her white throat and her tiny little
hands glittering with costly gems, while she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
leaned on his breast, happy as a queen, his loving
bride.</p>

<p>He wondered what had become of Malcolm
Dean, and why his ardent admiration of Liane
had waned so soon.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the thought the
doorbell rang, and Malcolm Dean's card was presented
to him.</p>

<p>"Show the gentleman in."</p>

<p>They stood facing each other, the handsome
blond artist and the dark-haired millionaire, and
the latter recalled with a silent pang that Liane
preferred men with fair hair and blue eyes.</p>

<p>They shook hands cordially; then, as Dean sank
into a chair, he noted that he had grown pale and
thin.</p>

<p>"You have been ill?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for weeks, of a low fever that kept me in
bed in Philadelphia, while my heart was far away.
Can you guess where, Devereaux?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps at Stonecliff?"</p>

<p>"Then you have guessed at my passion for the
beautiful prize winner."</p>

<p>"It was patent to all observers that night,"
Devereaux answered, in a strangled voice, with a
fierce thumping of the heart. Oh, God, how cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
it was to discuss her with his fortunate rival, who
had only to ask and have.</p>

<p>Dean noticed nothing unusual. He continued
earnestly:</p>

<p>"I don't mind owning to the truth, Devereaux.
Yes, I lost my heart irretrievably that night to
lovely Liane Lester, and I made up my mind to
overlook the difference in our position and woo
her for my own. But I had to go to Philadelphia
the next day, and I was detained there some time
getting my design ready for the magazine, and
this was followed by a spell of illness. At length,
all impatience, I returned to Stonecliff two days
ago to seek the fair girl who had charmed me so.
Fancy my dismay when I found her gone, and no
clue to her whereabouts!"</p>

<p>Again Devereaux's heart thumped furiously.</p>

<p>"You loved her very much?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I adored her. She was to me the incarnation
of simple beauty and purity."</p>

<p>"And had you any token of her preference in
return?"</p>

<p>"None. She was too shy and bashful to give
me the sign the coquette might have deemed befitting.
She hid her heart beneath the drooping
fringe of her dark, curling lashes. Yet I dared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
to hope, and there was one thing in my favor: I
did not have a rival."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken!"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I was your rival!"</p>

<p>"You, Devereaux!"</p>

<p>They almost glared at each other, and Devereaux
said hoarsely:</p>

<p>"I was in love with Miss Lester before you ever
saw her face!"</p>

<p>"After all, that is not strange. Who could see
her and not love her? But was your suit successful?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Rejected?"</p>

<p>Devereaux flushed, then answered frankly:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Malcolm Dean could not conceal his joyful surprise.</p>

<p>"I cannot comprehend her rejection of your
suit. I should have thought you irresistible."</p>

<p>Devereaux struggled a moment with natural
pride and selfishness, then answered:</p>

<p>"She preferred you."</p>

<p>"Me? How should you know?"</p>

<p>"By her own confession to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Malcolm Dean was frankly staggered by his
friend's statement. His blue eyes gleamed with
joy and his bosom heaved with pride.</p>

<p>"You have made me very happy, but how very,
very strange that she should have made such a
confession to you," he cried, in wonder.</p>

<p>Again Devereaux had a short, sharp struggle
with his better self and his natural jealousy of the
more fortunate lover of Liane, then his pity for
the girl triumphed over every selfish instinct, and
he said:</p>

<p>"She was very frank with me&mdash;the frankness
of innocence that saw no harm in the confidence.
On the same principle I see no harm in confiding
in you, Dean;" and he impulsively drew from his
breast Liane's letter.</p>

<p>Had he dreamed of the fatal consequences, he
would have withheld his eager hand.</p>

<p>There is love and love&mdash;love that has shallow
roots and love that cannot be dragged up from
its firm foundations.</p>

<p>"Read!" said Devereaux, generously placing in
his rival's hand Liane's letter.</p>

<p>For himself he could have forgiven all her
faults of innocence and ignorance could she but
have returned his love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>It did not occur to his mind that the artist could
be in any way different; that the ill spelling and
the puerile mind evinced by the letter would inspire
him with keen disgust.</p>

<p>It only seemed to him that all these faults could
be remedied by Liane by the influence of a true
love. The glamour of a strong passion was upon
him, blinding him to the truth that instantly became
patent to Dean's mind.</p>

<p>The artist, reading the shallow effusion, flung
it down in keen disgust.</p>

<p>"Heavens, what a disappointment! Such
beauty and apparent sweetness united to shallowness
and vanity!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It calls forth your pity?" Devereaux said.</p>

<p>"It excites my scorn!" the artist replied hotly.</p>

<p>"Remember her misfortunes&mdash;her bringing up
by that wretched old relative in want and ignorance.
Surely the influence of love will work
every desirable change in the fair girl who loves
you so fondly," argued Devereaux.</p>

<p>Malcolm Dean was pacing the floor excitedly.</p>

<p>"You could not change the shallow nature indicated
by that letter, if you loved her to distraction,"
he exclaimed. "Mark how she confesses
to deliberate coquetry to win you from your betrothed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
how cold-bloodedly she gloats over her
triumph. Why, my love is dead in an instant,
Devereaux, slain by this glimpse at Liane Lester's
real nature. Thank fortune, I did not find her
at Stonecliff yesterday. I shall never seek her
now, for my eyes are opened by that heartless letter.
Why are you staring at me so reproachfully,
Devereaux? You have even more cause to despise
than I have."</p>

<p>"And yet I cannot do it; Heaven help me, I love
her still!" groaned the other, bowing his pale face
upon his hands.</p>

<p>"But, Devereaux; this is madness! She is not
worth your love. Fling the poison from your
heart as I do. Forget the light coquette. Return
to your first love."</p>

<p>"Never!" he cried; but in all his pain he could
not help an unconscious joy that Liane could yet
be won.</p>

<p>He had not meant to turn Dean's heart against
her, but the mischief was done now. Poor little
girl! Would she hate him if she knew?</p>

<p>The old pitying tenderness surged over him
again, and he longed to take her in his arms and
shield her from all the assaults of the cruel world.
Vain and shallow she might be; coquette she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
might be, yet she had stormed the citadel of his
heart and held it still against all intruders.</p>

<p>"I am going now," the artist cried; turning on
him restlessly. "This is good-by for months, Devereaux.
I think I shall join some friends of mine
who are going to winter in Italy, to study art, you
know. Wish you would come with us."</p>

<p>"I should like to, but my father is lately dead,
you know, and Lieutenant Carrington, my sister's
husband, is ordered to sea with his ship. I cannot
leave Lyde alone, poor girl."</p>

<p>"Then good-by, and thank you for showing me
that letter. What if I had married her in ignorance?"
with a shudder. "For Heaven's sake,
Devereaux, be careful of getting into her toils
again. Better go back to Miss Clarke, and make
up your quarrel. Adieu," and with a hearty handclasp,
he was gone, leaving his friend almost paralyzed
with the remorseful thought:</p>

<p>"Would she ever forgive me if she guessed the
harm I have done?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A HARVEST OF WOE.</p>


<p>Devereaux's thoughts clung persistently to
Liane. He could not shut away from his mind
her haunting image.</p>

<p>Pity blended with tenderness, as putting himself
and his own disappointment aside, he gave
himself up to thoughts of bettering her poverty-stricken
life, so toilsome and lonely.</p>

<p>He took up his pen and wrote feelingly to Edmund
Clarke, telling him how and where he had
found Liane again, and of his full belief in her
purity and innocence, despite the cruel slanders
circulating in Stonecliff, the work, no doubt, he
said, of some jealous, unscrupulous enemy.</p>

<p>He assured Mr. Clarke that he was ready to assist
in any way he might suggest in bettering the
fair young girl's hard lot in life.</p>

<p>The letter was immediately posted, and went on
its fateful way to fall into jealous Roma's hands
and work a harvest of woe.</p>

<p>Affairs at Cliffdene were already in a critical
stage, and it wanted but this letter to fan the
smoldering flames into devastating fury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Clarke, impatient of his lingering convalescence,
had taken a decisive step toward recovering
his lost daughter.</p>

<p>He had written a letter summoning old Doctor
Jay, of Brookline, on a visit, and he had explained
it to his wife by pretending he wished to avail
himself of the old man's medical skill.</p>

<p>Doctor Jay was the physician who had attended
Mrs. Clarke when her daughter was born,
and he received a warm welcome at Cliffdene, a
guest whom all delighted to honor; all, at least,
but Roma, who immediately conceived an unaccountable
aversion to the old man, perhaps because
his little hazel-gray eyes peered at her so
curiously through his glasses beneath his bushy
gray eyebrows.</p>

<p>There was something strange in his intent scrutiny,
so coldly curious, instead of kindly, as she
had a right to expect, and she said pettishly to
her mother:</p>

<p>"I detest Doctor Jay. I hope he is not going to
stay long."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I suppose not, but I am very fond of
Doctor Jay. He was very kind and sympathetic
to me at a time of great suffering and trouble,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Mrs. Clarke replied so warmly that she aroused
Roma's curiosity.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke had never been able to recall that
time without suffering, but she impulsively told
Roma the whole story, never dreamed of until
now, of the loss of her infant and its mysterious
restoration at the last moment, when her life was
sinking away hopelessly into eternity.</p>

<p>Roma listened with startled attention, and she
began to ask questions that her mother found impossible
to answer.</p>

<p>"Who had stolen away the babe, and by what
agency had it been restored?" demanded Roma.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke could not satisfy her curiosity.
The subject was so painful her husband would
never discuss it with her, she declared, adding
that Roma must not think of it any more, either.</p>

<p>But, being in a reminiscent mood, she presently
told Roma how she had been deceived in old
Granny Jenks' identity, and how indignantly the
old woman had denied the imputation of having
been her nurse.</p>

<p>"I was so sure of her identity that her anger
was quite embarrassing," she said.</p>

<p>Roma's thoughts returned to granny's affection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
for herself, and she felt sure the old woman had
lied to her mother, though from what object she
could not conceive. Her abject affection for herself
seemed fully explained by the fact of her
having been her nurse child.</p>

<p>But she was, somehow, ill at ease after hearing
her mother's story, and longed eagerly to know
more than she had already heard.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I dare question papa or the old
doctor?" she thought when her mother had left
her alone, resting easily in her furred dressing
gown and slippers before a bright coal fire, while
in the room beyond Dolly Dorr was getting her
bath ready.</p>

<p>Roma was devoured by curiosity. She sat
racking her brain for a pretext to intrude on her
father and the old doctor, who were still in the
library together, chatting over old times when the
Clarkes had lived in Brookline.</p>

<p>A lucky thought came to her, and she murmured:</p>

<p>"I will pretend to have a headache, and ask
Doctor Jay for something to ease it. Then I will
stay a while chatting with them and making myself
very agreeable until I can bring the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
around, and get the interesting fact of my abduction
out of them."</p>

<p>Stealing noiselessly from the room, she glided
downstairs like a shadow, pausing abruptly at the
hall table, for there lay the evening's mail, just
brought in by a servant from the village post
office.</p>

<p>Roma turned over the letters and papers, finding
none for any one but her father, but the superscription
on one made her start with a stifled
cry.</p>

<p>She recognized the elegant chirography of
Jesse Devereaux on the back of one letter.</p>

<p>"Now, why is he writing to papa?" she wondered,
eagerly turning the letter over and over
in her burning hand, wild with curiosity that
tempted her at last to slip the letter into her
bosom.</p>

<p>Then, taking the rest of the mail in her hand,
Roma went to the library, thinking that the delivery
of the mail would furnish another plausible
pretext for her intrusion.</p>

<p>There was a little anteroom just adjoining the
library, and this she entered first to wait a moment
till the fierce beating of her heart over Devereaux's
letter should quiet down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>Her slippered feet made no sound on the thick
velvet carpet, and, as she rested for a moment in
a large armchair, she could hear the murmur of
animated voices through the heavy portires that
hung between her and the library.</p>

<p>Believing that the whole family had retired,
and that they were safe from interruption, Doctor
Jay and his host had returned to the tragedy of
eighteen years before&mdash;the loss of the infant that
had nearly cost the mother's life.</p>

<p>Roma caught her breath with a stifled gasp of
self-congratulation, hoping now to hear the whole
interesting story without moving from her chair.</p>

<p>In her hope she was not disappointed.</p>

<p>"I have never ceased to regret the substitution
of that spurious infant in place of my own lovely
child," sighed Mr. Clarke.</p>

<p>Roma gave a start of consternation, and almost
betrayed herself by screaming out aloud, but she
bit her lips in time, while her wildly throbbing
heart seemed to sink like a stone in her breast.</p>

<p>Doctor Jay said questioningly:</p>

<p>"You have never been able to love your adopted
daughter as your own?"</p>

<p>"Never, never!" groaned Edmund Clarke despairingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"And her mother?"</p>

<p>"She knows nothing, suspects nothing; for the
one object of my life has been to keep her in ignorance
of the truth that Roma is not her own
child. She has an almost slavish devotion to the
girl, but I think in her inmost heart she realizes
Roma's lack of lovable qualities, though she is
too loyal to her child to admit the truth even to
me."</p>

<p>"It is strange, most strange, that no clue has
ever been found that would lead to the discovery
of your lost little one," mused the old doctor, and
after a moment's silence the other answered:</p>

<p>"One thing I would like to know, and that is the
family from which Roma sprang. It must have
been low, judging frankly from the girl herself."</p>

<p>The listener clinched her hands till the blood
oozed from the tender palms on hearing these
words, and she would have liked to clutch the
speaker's throat instead.</p>

<p>But she sat still, like one paralyzed, a deadly
hatred tugging at her heartstrings, listening as
one listens to the sentence of death, while Doctor
Jay cleared his throat, and answered:</p>

<p>"I am sorry, most sorry, that your surmises are
correct, but naturally one would not expect to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
good blood in a foundling asylum, though when
I sent Nurse Jenks for the child, I told her to get
an infant of honest parentage, if she could."</p>

<p>"Then you know Roma's antecedents?" Mr.
Clarke questioned anxiously.</p>

<p>"My dear friend, I wish that you would not
press the subject."</p>

<p>"Answer me; I must know! The bitterest truth
could not exceed my suspicions!" almost raved
Mr. Clarke in his eagerness, and again the
clinched hands of the listener tightened as if they
were about his throat.</p>

<p>Hate, swift, terrible, murderous, had sprung
to life, full grown in the angry girl's heart.</p>

<p>She heard the old doctor cough and sigh again,
and a futile wish rose in her that he had dropped
down dead before he ever came to Cliffdene.</p>

<p>Doctor Jay, all unconscious of her proximity
and her charitable wishes, proceeded hesitatingly:</p>

<p>"Since you insist, I must own the truth. Nurse
Jenks deceived me."</p>

<p>"How?" hoarsely.</p>

<p>"She never went near the foundling asylum.
She had at her own home an infant, the child of a
worthless daughter, who had run away previously
to go on the stage. Leaving this child on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
mother's hands, the actress again ran away, and
the old grandmother palmed it off on you as a
foundling."</p>

<p>"My God! I see it all," groaned Edmund
Clarke. "The old fiend exchanged infants, putting
her grandchild in the place of my daughter,
and raising her in poverty and wretchedness. I
have seen my child with her, my beautiful daughter.
Listen to my story," he cried, pouring out to
the astonished old physician the whole moving
story of Liane Lester.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AT A FIEND'S MERCY.</p>


<p>Doctor Jay listened with breathless attention,
and so did Roma.</p>

<p>Pale as a breathing statue, her great eyes dilated
with dismay and horror, her heart beating
heavily and slow, Roma crouched in her chair
and listened to the awful words that told her who
and what she was, the base-born child of Cora
Jenks, and granddaughter of old granny, whose
very name was a synonym for contempt in Stonecliff.</p>

<p>She, Roma, who despised poor people, who
treated them no better than the dust beneath her
well-shod feet, belonged to the common herd, and
was usurping the place of beautiful Liane, whom
she had despised for her lowly estate and hated
for her beauty, but who had become first her rival
in love and now in fortune.</p>

<p>To the day of her death beautiful, wicked Roma
never forgot that bleak November night, that
blasted all her pride and flung her down into the
dust of humiliation and despair, her towering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
pride crushed, all the worst passions of her evil
nature aroused into pernicious activity.</p>

<p>Stiller than chiseled marble, the stricken girl
crouched there, listening, fearing to lose even a
single word, though each one quivered like a dagger
in her heart.</p>

<p>Her greatest enemy could not have wished her
a keener punishment than this knowledge of her
position in the Clarke household&mdash;an adopted
daughter, secretly despised and only tolerated for
the mother's sake, holding her place only until the
real heiress should be discovered.</p>

<p>No words could paint her rage, her humiliation,
her terrors of the future, that held a sword that
might at any moment fall.</p>

<p>Oh, how she hated the world, and every one in
it, and most of all Liane Lester, her guiltless
rival.</p>

<p>While she listened, she wished the girl dead a
hundred times, and all at once a throbbing memory
came to her of the fierce words Granny Jenks
had spoken in her rage against Liane.</p>

<p>"I would beat her; yes, I would kill her, before
she should steal your grand lover from you darling!"</p>

<p>Roma could understand now the old hag's devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
to herself. It was the tie of their kinship asserting
itself. She shuddered with disgust as she
recalled the old woman's fulsome admiration and
adoration, and how she had been willing to sell
her very soul for one kiss from those fresh, rosy
lips.</p>

<p>How eagerly she had said:</p>

<p>"I will scold Liane, and whip her, too. I will
do anything to please you, beautiful lady!"</p>

<p>No wonder!</p>

<p>Roma was bitterly sorry now that she had not
let granny kill Liane when she had been so anxious
to do it. She felt that she had made a great
mistake, for her position at Cliffdene would never
be assured until Liane was dead.</p>

<p>Edmund Clarke was certain now that Liane
was his own child, and he swore to Doctor Jay
that he would find her soon, if it took the last dollar
of his fortune.</p>

<p>The old doctor replied:</p>

<p>"I do not blame you, my friend, for it does, indeed,
appear plausible that this Liane Lester must
be your own lost child, and I can conceive how
galling it must be to your pride to call Nurse
Jenks' grandchild your daughter, while, as for
your noble wife, it is cruel to think of the imposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
practiced on her motherly love all these years.
But it is certain that she must have died but for
the terrible deception we had to practice."</p>

<p>Edmund Clarke knew that it was true. He
remembered how she had been drifting from him
out on the waves of the shoreless sea, and how
the piping cry of the little infant had called her
back to life and hope.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a terrible necessity," he groaned,
adding:</p>

<p>"And only think, dear doctor, how sad it is that
Roma, with a devilish cunning, that must be a
keen instinct, has always hated sweet Liane, and
has succeeded in poisoning my wife's mind
against her, arousing a mean jealousy in my uncomprehended
interest in the girl! Think of such
a sweet mother being set against her own sweet
daughter!"</p>

<p>"It is horrible," assented Doctor Jay, and he
continued:</p>

<p>"But this excitement is telling on your nerves,
dear friend, weakened by your recent severe illness.
Let me persuade you to retire to bed, with
a sedative now, and to-morrow we will further
discuss your plan of employing a detective to trace
Liane and the fiendish Nurse Jenks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe I will take your advice," Roma heard
Edmund Clarke respond wearily, and Doctor Jay
insisted on preparing a sedative, which he said
should be mixed in a glass of water, half the dose
to be taken on retiring, and the remainder in two
hours, if the patient proved wakeful.</p>

<p>"I wish it was a dose of poison," Roma thought
vindictively, as she hurried from the room and
gained her own unperceived, where she found her
maid waiting most impatiently to assist her in her
bath.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Dolly, you can go to bed now. I
went to mamma's room for a little chat, and we
talked longer than I expected, so I will wait on
myself this once," she said, with unwonted kindness
in her eagerness to be alone; so Dolly curtsied
and retired, though she said to herself:</p>

<p>"She is lying. She was not in her mother's
room at all, for I went there to see, and Mrs.
Clarke had retired. She must have been up to
some mischief and don't want to be found out.
She had a guilty look."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Roma flung herself into the easy-chair
before the glowing fire, stretched out her
slippered feet on the thick fur rug, and gave herself
up to the bitterest reflections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are four people who are terribly in
my way, and whom I would like to see dead!
They are Liane Lester, Granny Jenks, old Doctor
Jay, and Edmund Clarke, the man I have heretofore
regarded as my father," she muttered vindictively.</p>

<p>She knew that the two last named would know
neither rest nor peace till they found Liane and
reinstated her in her place at Cliffdene as daughter
and heiress, ousting without remorse the
usurper.</p>

<p>"Ah, if I only knew where to find her, granny
would soon put her out of my way forever!" she
thought, regretting bitterly now that she had not
made the old hag keep her informed of her whereabouts.</p>

<p>The spirit of murder was rife in Roma's heart,
and she longed to end the lives of all those who
stood in her way.</p>

<p>"I wish that Edmund Clarke would die to-night!
How easy it would be if some arsenic
were dropped into his sedative&mdash;some of that
solution I was taking a while ago to improve my
complexion," she thought darkly, resolving to
wait until all was quiet and herself attempt the
hellish deed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>One death already lay on her conscience, and
the form of the man she had remorselessly thrust
over the bluff stalked grimly through her dreams.
To her soul, already black with crime, what did
the commission of other deeds of darkness matter?</p>

<p>The death of Edmund Clarke so quickly decreed,
she began to plan that of the old doctor.</p>

<p>This was not so easy. He did not have a convenient
glass of sedative ready by his bedside.
But she had noticed at supper that he was fond
of a glass of wine.</p>

<p>"I must poison a draught for him before he
leaves Cliffdene," she thought, regretting that she
could not accomplish it to-night.</p>

<p>But Edmund Clarke's speedy death would delay
the search for Liane a while, even if it did not
postpone it forever.</p>

<p>For the old physician was not likely to prosecute
it after the death of his patron. He could
have no interest in doing so, though she would
make sure he did not by putting him out of the
way if she could.</p>

<p>Her mind a chaos of evil thoughts, Roma rested
in her chair, waiting till she thought every one
must be asleep before she stole from the room to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
poison the draught for the man she had regarded
until this hour as her own father, and to whose
wealth she owed her luxurious life of eighteen
years.</p>

<p>Neither pity nor gratitude warmed her cold
heart. She had never loved him in her life, and
she hated him now.</p>

<p>In her rage and despair she had forgotten
Jesse Devereaux's letter to her father until, in a
restless movement, she heard the rustle of paper
in her corsage.</p>

<p>An evil gleam lightened in her eyes, and she
drew the letter forth, muttering:</p>

<p>"Ah, this will beguile my weary waiting!"</p>

<p>In five minutes she was mistress of the contents.</p>

<p>It was the letter Devereaux had written to acquaint
Edmund Clarke with Liane's address&mdash;the
fateful letter that was to betray the girl into the
hands of her bitterest foe.</p>

<p>Ah, the hellish gleam of wicked joy in the cruel
red-brown eyes; the stormy heaving of Roma's
breast as she realized her great good fortune;
all her enemies in her power, at her mercy! The
mercy the ravenous wolf shows to the helpless
lamb!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>She laughed low and long in her glee, and that
laughter was an awful thing to hear.</p>

<p>"Oh, how can I wait till to-morrow?" she muttered.
"Yet I cannot go to Boston to-night, nor
to-morrow, if Edmund Clarke dies to-night.
Shall I spare his life till I go to Boston, and have
his daughter put out of the way?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A MURDEROUS FURY.</p>


<p>Hours slipped away while the beautiful fiend,
so young in years, so old in the conception of
crime, crouched in her seat, waiting, musing,
pondering on the best schemes for ridding herself
of those who stood in her way.</p>

<p>She was eager as a wild beast to strike quickly
and finish the awful work she had set herself
to do.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she might never have another
such opportunity for ending Edmund
Clarke's life as was offered to her by the conditions
of the present moment.</p>

<p>It was most important to get rid of him, she
knew, and the sooner the better for the safety of
her position as heiress of the Clarke millions. Let
him die first, and she could attend to the others
afterward.</p>

<p>At the dark, gloomy hour of midnight, while
the icy winds wailed around the house like a
banshee, Roma went groping through the pitch-black
corridors toward the room where Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Clarke lay sleeping with his gentle, loving wife
by his side.</p>

<p>Like a sleek, beautiful panther the girl crept
into the unlocked door, knowing the room so well
that she could find her way to the bedside in the
darkness, and put out her stealthy, murderous
hand, with the bottle of poison in it, seeking for
the glass that held the sleeping potion Doctor Jay
had prescribed.</p>

<p>Her heart beat with evil exultation, for it
seemed to her that her errand could scarcely fail
of success. Edmund Clarke was sound asleep,
she knew by his deep breathing, and she decided
that, after pouring the poison into the glass, she
would make enough noise in escaping from the
room to arouse him fully, so that he would be sure
to swallow the second dose ere sleeping again.</p>

<p>It was a clever plan, cleverly conceived, and in
another moment it would be executed, and no
earthly power could save the victim from untimely
death.</p>

<p>But in her haste Roma made one fatal mistake.</p>

<p>In groping for the glass, she held the vial with
the arsenic clasped in her hand.</p>

<p>And she was very nervous, her white hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
trembling as they fluttered over the little medicine
stand by the head of the bed.</p>

<p>That was why, the next moment, there came
the sharp clink of glass against glass as her hands
came in contact with what she sought, overturning
and breaking both, with such a sharp, keen,
crystalline tinkle that both the sleepers were
aroused suddenly and quickly, and Mr. Clarke
flung out his arms, clutching Roma ere she could
escape, and demanding bewilderedly:</p>

<p>"What is the matter? Who is this?"</p>

<p>"Edmund! Edmund!" cried his equally startled
wife, hastily lighting a night lamp close to her
arm, in time to see Roma writhing and struggling
in her father's arms.</p>

<p>"Roma!" he panted.</p>

<p>"Roma!" echoed his wife.</p>

<p>It was a situation to strike terror to the girl's
guilty heart.</p>

<p>But in her scheming she had not failed to take
into account any possible contretemps.</p>

<p>Failing in her efforts to escape before her identity
was detected, Roma laughed aloud, hysterically:</p>

<p>"Dear papa, do not squeeze me so hard, please;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
you take away my breath! Why, you must take
me for a burglar!"</p>

<p>Edmund Clarke, releasing her and not yet fully
awake, stammered drowsily:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I&mdash;took&mdash;you&mdash;for&mdash;a&mdash;burglar. What
do you want, Roma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what is the matter, my dear?" added
Mrs. Clarke wonderingly, while Roma, mistress
of the situation still, pressed her hand to her
cheek, groaning hysterically:</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, mamma, forgive me for arousing
you, but I am suffering so much with a wretched
toothache, and I came to ask you for some medicine
to ease it!"</p>

<p>"Poor dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Clarke, with immediate
maternal sympathy, as she rose quickly
from her bed and motioned Roma into her dressing
room, searching for remedies within a little
medicine case while she plied her with questions.</p>

<p>"When did it begin to ache, dear? Why didn't
you send Dolly for the medicine? It will make
you worse, coming along the cold corridors!"</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, don't tease! Give me the
medicine quick as you can!" Roma answered
crossly, dropping into a chair and hiding her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
in her hands, her whole form shaking with fury at
the failure of her scheme to kill Edmund Clarke.</p>

<p>A blind, terrible rage possessed her, and she
would have liked to spring upon him and clutch
his throat with murderous hands.</p>

<p>But she dare not give way to her murderous
impulse; she must wait and try her luck again,
for die he must, and that very soon.</p>

<p>She could only wreak her pent-up rage by cross
answers to the gentle lady she called mother, and
Mrs. Clarke, with a patient sigh of wounded feeling,
turned to her, replying:</p>

<p>"I did not mean to tease you, Roma, but here is
some medicine. Put five drops of it upon this bit
of cotton and press it into the cavity of your tooth,
and it will give you speedy relief. In the morning
you must visit a dentist."</p>

<p>Roma lifted her pale face, and answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, I will visit a dentist, but not one at
Stonecliff. I will go to Boston by the early train."</p>

<p>"I will go with you and do some shopping," said
her mother, who had a very feminine love of
finery.</p>

<p>"Very well," the girl answered, scowling behind
her hand, for she preferred to go alone on her
mission to Granny Jenks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>But she realized that it would not do to offend
the only person who seemed to have any real fondness
for her, so, making a wry face behind her
hand, she went up to Mrs. Clarke, saying gently:</p>

<p>"I did not mean to be cross to you, dear
mamma, but I am in such agony with this pain
that I could not help my impatience. I want you
to forgive me and try not to love me any less for
my faults, please."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke could not help wondering what
favor Roma was planning to ask for now, but she
answered sweetly:</p>

<p>"I forgive you, dear, and, of course, I shall always
love my daughter."</p>

<p>"But papa does not love me much. I often
meet his glance fixed on me in cold disapproval,
and at times he is very stern to me!" complained
Roma.</p>

<p>"That must be your fancy, dear. He could not
help loving you, his own daughter, dearly and
fondly," soothed the lady, though she knew that
she had herself noticed and complained of the
same thing in her husband.</p>

<p>"You do not love Roma as I do," she had said
to him, reproachfully, many times, getting always
an evasive, unsatisfactory reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>So she could not offer her much comfort on this
score; she could only put her arm about the form
of the arch traitress, murmuring kind, tender
words, actually getting in return a loving caress
that surprised her very much, it was so unusual.</p>

<p>But Roma for the first time in her life comprehended
the necessity of fortifying her position by
a staunch ally like her mother.</p>

<p>"I will go back to my room now. I must not
keep you up any longer in the cold, dear, patient
mamma," she cried gushingly, as she kissed her
and left the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke was grateful for the caress, but
she retired to bed with the firm conviction that it
would take a very large check indeed to gratify
Roma's desires in Boston to-morrow. Her affectionate
spells were always very costly to her parents.</p>

<p>"Do you think I had better take the second dose
of that sedative? I am very nervous from my
sudden awakening, and wish we had locked the
door on retiring," her husband said petulantly.</p>

<p>"It would be very unkind to lock the door on
our own daughter. Roma was just now lamenting
your sternness and lack of love and sympathy,"
returned the lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Edmund Clarke stifled an imprecation between
his teeth, then demanded earnestly:</p>

<p>"Have I ever failed in love and sympathy to
you, dear Elinor?"</p>

<p>"Never, my darling husband," she answered,
fondly clasping his hand.</p>

<p>"And never will my love fail you, dearest; but I
cannot say as much for Roma, whose nature is so
unlike yours that I confess she repels instead of
attracts me," he exclaimed, reaching out for the
medicine and exclaiming impatiently on finding
the glass broken and the draught lost.</p>

<p>Ah, how nearly it had been a fatal draught,
had not Heaven interposed to save his life!</p>

<p>As he set it back on the table, he added:</p>

<p>"Why, here is a broken vial on the table beside
the glass. I wonder how it came there!"</p>

<p>"I do not know; but it really does not matter,
dear. There, now, shut your eyes, and try to
sleep," advised his wife, knowing the importance
of sound, healthful sleep to the convalescent.</p>

<p>But to her dismay he arose and turned the key
in the lock, saying as he lay down again:</p>

<p>"I'll try to sleep now; but I'll make sure first
of not being disturbed again."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A STRAND OF RUDDY HAIR.</p>


<p>At early daylight the next morning a servant
tapped at Edmund Clarke's door with a message
from Doctor Jay.</p>

<p>He found himself quite ill this morning, and
must go home at once. Would Mr. Clarke grant
him a few parting words?</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke was up and dressed. He had just
said good-by to his wife and Roma, who had
taken an early train to Boston.</p>

<p>He went at once to Doctor Jay's room, finding
him seated by the window, looking ill and aged
from a bad night.</p>

<p>"Good morning, my dear old friend. You look
ill, and I fear you have not rested well."</p>

<p>"No; my night was troubled by ghastly dreams.
I could scarcely wait till morning to bid you
good-by."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for this, for I had counted on
a pleasant day with you. My wife and Roma are
gone to Boston for the day, leaving their regrets
for you, and kindly wishes to find you here on
their return."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor started with surprise, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"It must have been an unexpected trip."</p>

<p>Edmund Clarke then explained about Roma's
midnight sufferings from toothache, necessitating
a visit to her dentist.</p>

<p>"My wife would not have left me, but she felt
sure I should not be lonely, having you for company,"
he added regretfully.</p>

<p>"My dear friend, I should like to remain with
you, and, rather than disappoint you, I will wait
until the late afternoon train; but&mdash;all my friendship
for you could not tempt me to spend another
night at Cliffdene!"</p>

<p>"You amaze me, doctor! This is very strange!
Why do you look so pale and strange? Why did
you spend so uncomfortable a night, when I tried
to surround you with every comfort?"</p>

<p>"You did, my dear friend, and every luxury besides&mdash;even
a key to my door, which I forgot to
use," returned Doctor Jay, so significantly that
Edmund Clarke reddened, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"It is not possible you have been robbed! I believe
that all my servants are honest!"</p>

<p>He thought that the old physician must be losing
his senses when he answered, with terrible
gravity:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I was nearly robbed of my life
last night!"</p>

<p>"Great heavens!"</p>

<p>Doctor Jay's brow was beaded with damp as he
loosened his cravat and collar, and pointed to his
bared neck.</p>

<p>Edmund Clarke leaned forward, and saw on
the old man's throat some dark purple discolorations,
like finger prints.</p>

<p>"Have you in your household any persons subject
to vicious aberrations of mind?" demanded
Doctor Jay.</p>

<p>"No one!" answered his startled host, and he
was astounded when his guest replied:</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, a fiend in human form entered
this room last night under cover of the darkness
and attempted to murder me by vicious
strangling!"</p>

<p>"Heavens! Is this so?"</p>

<p>"You have the evidence!" exclaimed the physician,
pointing to his bared throat with the print
of the strangler's fingers.</p>

<p>"This is most mysterious!" ejaculated Edmund
Clarke, in wonder and distress, while the physician
continued:</p>

<p>"Last night I retired and slept soundly until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
after midnight, when I was aroused by the horrible
sensation of steely fingers gripping my throat
with deadly force. Vainly gasping for my failing
breath, I struggled with the intruder, who
held on with a maniacal strength, panting with
fury as I clutched in my arms a form that I immediately
knew to be that of a woman, soft,
warm, palpitating, though her strength was certainly
equal to that of a man. We grappled in a
terrible struggle, and I clutched my fingers in her
long hair, causing her such pain that, with a
stifled moan, she released my throat, struck me in
the face, and fled before I could regain my senses,
that deserted me at the critical moment."</p>

<p>"This is most mysterious, most shocking! No
wonder you are anxious to leave Cliffdene, where
you so nearly met your death. But this must be
sifted to the bottom at once, and the lunatic identified,
for it could be no other than a lunatic. I
will have the whole household summoned. We
will question every servant closely!" cried Clarke
eagerly, turning to ring the bell.</p>

<p>But Doctor Jay stopped him, saying:</p>

<p>"Wait till I question you on the subject. Have
you in your employ a woman with red hair?"</p>

<p>"What a question! But, no. My women servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
are all gray-haired or black-haired, with one
exception. That is Roma's maid, a pretty little
blonde, with the palest flaxen curls."</p>

<p>He looked inquiringly at the doctor, who replied:</p>

<p>"After my struggle was over and I was able to
light a lamp, I found entangled in my fingers
some threads of hair&mdash;beautiful long strands of
ruddy hair, copperish red in the full light."</p>

<p>He took an envelope from his breast, and drew
from it a ruddy strand of long hair, holding it up
to the light of the window, where it shone with
a rich copper tint.</p>

<p>"My God!" groaned Edmund Clarke.</p>

<p>"You recognize the hair?" cried Doctor Jay.</p>

<p>"It is Roma's hair!" was the anguished answer.</p>

<p>"I thought so!"</p>

<p>"You thought so! Is the girl, then, a lunatic,
or a fiend? And what motive could she have
to take your life&mdash;an old man, who has never
harmed her in his blameless life?" cried the host,
in consternation.</p>

<p>Edmund Clarke had never been confronted
with such a terrible problem of crime in his life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
His face paled to an ashen hue, and his eyes almost
glared as he stared helplessly at his friend.</p>

<p>"I have a theory!" cried Doctor Jay.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"The girl must have overheard our conversation
last night."</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke revolved the matter silently in his
mind for a moment, then answered:</p>

<p>"Well, of course, not impossible, but quite improbable."</p>

<p>"Is there not a curtained alcove or anteroom
next the library?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but why should the girl have suspected
us&mdash;why concealed herself there to listen?"</p>

<p>"Heaven only knows, but it is possible that
some accident brought her there&mdash;perhaps an errand
of some kind&mdash;maybe to get medicine from
me for her aching tooth. She caught a few words
that aroused her curiosity, kept silence, and listened,
overhearing the truth about herself."</p>

<p>"It must indeed have happened that way!"</p>

<p>"And the shock drove her mad," continued
Doctor Jay. "Her resentment flamed against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
me for knowing so much of her low origin. In
her first senseless fury she sought my life."</p>

<p>"It is a terrible situation!" cried his friend, and
both were silent for a moment, gazing at the lock
of hair as if it had been a writhing serpent; then
Clarke continued:</p>

<p>"It is a wonder the fiend incarnate did not seek
my life also, thus removing from her path the two
who were plotting to oust her from her position
and reinstate the real heiress!"</p>

<p>But even as he spoke he remembered last
night's accident when he had been aroused by
the clink of breaking glass and found Roma in
hysterics by his bedside.</p>

<p>He told Doctor Jay the whole story, adding:</p>

<p>"I could not imagine how the bottle came there.
It was certainly not on the stand when I retired
to bed, and when I read the label this morning,
it ran: 'Poison&mdash;arsenic.'"</p>

<p>"I should like to see the bottle."</p>

<p>"Come with me," returned Mr. Clarke, leading
the way to his room.</p>

<p>Fortunately the chambermaid had not disturbed
anything yet, so the fragments of the bottle
and glass were found upon the table.</p>

<p>"It is a fearfully strong solution of arsenic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
and I fancy she intended to pour it into your
sedative, so that in case you drank it you would
be silenced forever," affirmed the doctor.</p>

<p>They could only stare aghast at each other,
feeling that Providence had surely preserved
their lives last night.</p>

<p>"She was nervous in the dark, jostling the bottle
against the glass, breaking both, and thus defeating
her murderous game! The toothache
was probably a clever feint to explain her presence
in your room," continued the old doctor, who
had a wonderful insight into men and motives,
and seemed to read Roma like an open book.</p>

<p>A sudden terror seized on Mr. Clarke.</p>

<p>"She has taken my darling wife away with
her! What if she means to murder her, too? I
must follow them on the next train and separate
them forever!" he cried frantically.</p>

<p>"I believe you are right, my friend."</p>

<p>After further thought and consultation, they
decided that, although Roma and Mrs. Clarke
must be immediately separated, it would not be
prudent to reveal the truth to her yet, for the
shock would be sufficient to dethrone her reason.
Therefore it would not be prudent to arrest
Roma yet for her attempted crimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have just time enough for a hasty breakfast
before catching the next train. Come!"
cried Edmund Clarke, leading the way from the
room.</p>

<p>In the corridor they encountered Dolly Dorr
mincing along, with her yellow head on one side
like a pert canary; and her master, stopping her,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Your mistress had a bad time with the toothache,
I fear, last night, Dolly!"</p>

<p>Dolly, dropping a curtsy, answered slyly:</p>

<p>"Indeed she did, sir, and the medicine she got
when she went after Doctor Jay didn't help her
one bit, for she walked the floor groaning and sobbing
all night."</p>

<p>They glared at her in amazement, while she
continued, with pretended sympathy:</p>

<p>"She would not let me sit up with her, poor
thing, but I was stealing back to her room to see
if I could help her any when I met her flying
out of Doctor Jay's room, and she said she had
gone for a remedy for the toothache, and he
burned her gums with iodine and almost set her
crazy with the pain. Then she scolded me for
being up so late, and sent me back to my room to
stay."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>She gave Doctor Jay a quizzical glance from
her saucy blue eyes, but his face was entirely noncommittal
as he replied:</p>

<p>"I am very sorry I burned her so badly with
the iodine, but I thought it would give the quickest
relief."</p>

<p>"Well, she has gone to a dentist in Boston now,
and he may soon help the pain," said Edmund
Clarke, passing on, while Dolly Dorr muttered
suspiciously:</p>

<p>"There were mysterious carryings on in this
house last night, for sure!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A TRUE FRIEND.</p>


<p>Liane Lester, late that afternoon, when coming
home from her work with her friend, Lizzie
White, saw again the handsome face and dark,
flashing eyes of Jesse Devereaux. He had believed
himself unseen, but he was mistaken.</p>

<p>Some subtle instinct had turned Liane's timid
glance straight to the spot where he was watching,
unseen, as he believed.</p>

<p>The quick, passionate throb of her heart sent
the blood bounding to her cheeks and made her
hands tremble as they clasped the envelope with
her slender weekly earnings.</p>

<p>But at the same instant Liane dropped the
thick, curling fringe of her lashes quickly over her
eyes, for in his alert glance she met no sign of
recognition, and her heart sank heavily again
as she remembered his cold, careless greeting the
day she had passed his house with Mrs. Brinkley.</p>

<p>The good woman was right. He might have
amused himself with her in the country, but he
was indifferent to her in town. He would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
even take the trouble to bow when they met by
chance, as now.</p>

<p>But Liane had the most loyal heart in the
world, and she could never forget that night by
the sea when Devereaux had saved her from the
insulting caresses of the dark-browed stranger,
and afterward from granny's blow, breaking his
arm in her defense.</p>

<p>"How brave and noble he was that night! He
was so handsome and adorable that my heart
went out to him, never to be recalled, in spite of
all that has happened since," she thought sadly.</p>

<p>With lowered lashes and a heart sinking heavily
with its hopeless love and pain, Liane passed
on with her friend, little dreaming that she was
followed to her home by Devereaux, nor what
dire consequences would follow on his learning
her address.</p>

<p>She was restless that night, and he haunted
her dreams persistently, and on the morrow she
rose tired, and pale, and sad, almost wishing she
had not met him again, to have all the old pain
and regret revived within her breast.</p>

<p>The long day dragged away, and when she
went home that evening she found awaiting her
the Philadelphia magazine that had her beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
face on the outside cover. Accompanying this
was a batch of novels, together with a basket of
fruit and a bunch of roses.</p>

<p>"Hothouse roses and tropical fruit&mdash;you must
have caught a rich beau, Liane!" cried Mrs.
Brinkley, as she delivered the gifts.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; there must be some mistake," she answered
quickly, but her heart throbbed as she remembered
the meeting with Devereaux yesterday,
and she wondered if he could possibly be the
donor.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" she sighed to herself, as the
woman continued:</p>

<p>"There cannot be any mistake, for there is the
card, tied to the basket, with 'Miss Liane Lester,
with kind wishes of a true friend,' written on it.
They came by a neat messenger boy, who would
not answer a single question I asked him."</p>

<p>"A charming mystery! Oh, what magnificent
roses for the last of November!" cried Lizzie, inhaling
their fragrance with delight, while Liane
handed around the basket, generously sharing the
luscious fruit with her friends.</p>

<p>She was thinking all the while of the words
Jesse Devereaux had said to her on the beach that
never-to-be-forgotten night:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will be a true friend to you."</p>

<p>The card on the basket read the same: "A
True Friend."</p>

<p>It was enough to send the tremulous color flying
to Liane's cheek, while a new, faint hope
throbbed at her heart.</p>

<p>Granny was out somewhere, or she would have
got a scolding on suspicion of knowing the donor
of the presents. She wisely kept the truth to herself,
dividing the fruit with her friends, placing
the books in her trunk, and the roses in a vase in
Lizzie's room, though she longed very much to
have them in her own.</p>

<p>That night her dreams were sweet and rose-colored.</p>

<p>She went to work with a blithe heart next
morning, and, although it was the first day of
December, and a light covering of snow lay on
the roofs and pavements, she did not feel the biting
wind pierce through her thin jacket; her pulse
was bounding and her being in a glow because
of the great scarlet rose pinned on her breast,
seeming to shed a summer warmth and sweetness
on the icy air&mdash;the warmth of hope and love.</p>

<p>All day her visions were rose-colored, and her
thoughts hovered about Devereaux until she almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
forgot where she was, and was recalled unpleasantly
to reality by a proud, impatient voice
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I have spoken to you twice, and you have not
heard me! Your thoughts must be very far away.
Show me your best kid gloves&mdash;five and a half
size!"</p>

<p>At the same moment a small hand had gently
pressed her arm, sending an odd thrill through
her whole frame, causing her to start and look
up at a handsome, richly dressed woman, whose
dark-blue eyes were fixed on her in surprise and
dislike.</p>

<p>She knew the proud, cold face instantly. It belonged
to a woman she had seen on Edmund
Clarke's arm the night of the beauty contest. It
was his wife, the mother of haughty Roma, and
Liane comprehended instantly her glance of anger&mdash;it
was because she had taken the prize over
Roma's head.</p>

<p>Wounded and abashed by the lady's scorn,
Liane attended to her wants in timid silence, only
speaking when necessary, her cheeks flushed, her
soft eyes downcast, her white hands fluttering
nervously over the gloves.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke selected a box of gloves, paid for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
them, and said in a supercilious tone, quite different
from her usual gentle manner:</p>

<p>"I will take the gloves with me. You may bring
them out to my carriage on the opposite side of
the street."</p>

<p>She was purposely humbling Liane, and the
girl felt it intuitively. Her bosom heaved, and
her blue eyes brimmed with dew, but she did not
resent the proud command, only took up the box
of gloves and followed her customer out of the
store to the thickly crowded pavement and over
the crossing, where a carriage waited in a throng
of vehicles on the other side.</p>

<p>All at once something terrible happened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke, keeping proudly in front of Liane,
and not noticing closely enough her environment
of vehicles and street cars, suddenly found herself
right in the path of an electric car that in
another moment would have crushed out her life
had not two small hands reached out and hurled
her swiftly aside.</p>

<p>Hundreds of eyes had seen the lady's imminent
peril, and marked with kindling admiration the
girl's heroic deed.</p>

<p>Without a selfish thought, though she was exposing
herself to deadly danger, Liane bounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
wildly upon the track and seized the dazed and
immovable woman with frantic hands, dragging
her by main force off the track of the car that, in
the succeeding moment, whizzed by at its highest
speed, just as the two, Liane and the rescued
woman, fell to the ground outside the wheels.</p>

<p>Eager, sympathetic men bore them to the pavement,
where it was found that Mrs. Clarke was in
a swoon, so deathlike that it frightened Liane,
who sobbed and wrung her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, she is dead! The terrible shock has killed
her! Can no one do anything to bring back her
life? She must not die! She has a loving husband
and a beautiful daughter, who would break
their hearts over their terrible loss!"</p>

<p>"Who is she?" they asked the sobbing girl, and
she answered:</p>

<p>"She is Mrs. Clarke, a wealthy lady of Stonecliff,
and must be visiting in the city."</p>

<p>At that moment the lady's eyes fluttered open,
she gazed with a dazed air on the curious faces
that surrounded her, and murmured:</p>

<p>"Where am I? What has happened?"</p>

<p>There were not lacking a dozen voices to tell
her everything, loud in praise of the lovely girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
who had saved her life at the imminent risk of
her own.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I did no more than my duty!" she sobbed,
blushing crimson while they all gazed on her with
the warmest admiration. There are so few who
do their duty even in this cold, hard world, and
one man exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It was not your duty to risk your life so
nearly. Why, the car fender brushed your skirt
as you fell. It was an act of the purest heroism!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke pressed her hand to her brow bewilderingly,
murmuring:</p>

<p>"I remember it all now! I stepped thoughtlessly
on the track, and when I saw the car rushing
down on me, I was so dazed with fear and
horror I could not move or speak! No, though
my very life depended on it, I could not move or
speak! I could only stand like a statue, a breathing
statue of horror, facing death! My feet were
glued to the rail, my eyes stared before me in
mute despair! Horrible anticipations thronged
my mind! Suddenly I was caught by frantic
hands and dragged aside! I realized I was saved,
and consciousness fled."</p>

<p>At that moment the carriage driver, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
got down from his box and was waiting on the
curb, advanced, and said anxiously:</p>

<p>"Shall I take you back to the hotel, madam?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes." She glanced around at Liane, and
put out a yearning hand. "Come with me, dear
girl. I&mdash;I am too ill to go alone. Let me lean
on your strength."</p>

<p>Somehow Liane could not refuse the request.
She felt a strange, sweet tenderness flooding her
heart for the proud lady who, up to the present
time, had used her so cruelly in unfair resentment.</p>

<p>She sent a message explaining her absence
across to the store, and led Mrs. Clarke's faltering
steps to the carriage.</p>

<p>"Oh, I dropped the box of gloves in my rush
to drag you from the track! I must go back for
them!" she cried, in dismay.</p>

<p>"No, miss, here they are. An honest man
picked them up and handed them up on the box
this instant," said the driver, producing the
gloves.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear girl, no need to think of gloves
at a moment like this! How can I ever thank
you and bless you enough for your noble heroism
that saved my life!" cried Mrs. Clarke fervently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>She gazed in gratitude and admiration at the
exquisite face that owed none of its charm to
extraneous adornment. The wealth of sun-flecked,
chestnut locks rippled back in rich waves
from the pure white brow, the great purplish-blue
eyes, the exquisite features, the dainty coloring
of the skin; above all, the expression of innocence
and sweetness pervading all, thrilled Mrs.
Clarke's heart with such keen pleasure that she
quite forgot it was this radiant beauty that had
rivaled Roma in the contest for the prize. She
said to herself that here was the loveliest and the
bravest girl in the whole world.</p>

<p>The carriage rattled along the busy streets,
and Liane timidly disclaimed any need of praise;
she had but tried to do her duty.</p>

<p>"Duty!" cried Mrs. Clarke, and somehow her
cold, nervous hand stole into Liane's, and nestled
there like a trembling bird, while she continued
with keen self-reproach:</p>

<p>"You have returned good for evil in the most
generous fashion. I was treating you in the most
haughty and resentful manner, trying to sting
your girlish pride and make you conscious of
your inferiority. Did you understand my motive?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were naturally a little vexed with me because
I had carried off the prize for which your
lovely daughter competed," Liane murmured
bashfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I was wickedly unjust. You deserved
the prize. Roma, with all her gifts of
birth and fortune, is not one-half so beautiful as
you, Liane Lester, the poor girl," cried Mrs.
Clarke warmly. "Do you know I am quite proud
that my husband says you resemble me in my
girlhood; but, to be frank, I am sure I was never
half so pretty."</p>

<p>Liane blushed with delight at her kindness, and
bashfully told her of her meeting on the beach
with Mr. Clarke, when he had impulsively called
her Elinor.</p>

<p>"He told me then that I greatly resembled his
wife!" she added, gazing admiringly at the still
handsome woman, and feeling proud in her heart
to look like her, so strangely was her heart interested.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke could not help saying, so greatly
were her feelings changed toward Liane:</p>

<p>"My husband admires you greatly; did you
know it? He wishes to befriend you, making
you an honored member of our household. I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
he would permit me to adopt you as a daughter,
so strong will be his gratitude for your act
of to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, madam!" faltered Liane, in grateful bewilderment,
feeling that she could be very happy
with these kind people, only for proud, willful
Roma, and she added:</p>

<p>"Your handsome daughter would not want me
as a sister!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke hesitated, then answered reassuringly:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, when she learns how you saved
my life to-day, Roma cannot help but love you
dearly!"</p>

<p>The carriage stopped in front of a grand hotel,
and she added:</p>

<p>"I want you to come in and stay all day with
me, Liane, dear. I am too nervous to be left
alone, and Roma has gone to a dentist and will
not be back until late afternoon."</p>

<p>Liane went with her new friend into the grand
hotel, and they spent a happy day together, the tie
of blood, undreamed of by either, strongly asserting
itself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke found Liane a charming and congenial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
companion, as different from selfish, hateful
Roma as daylight from darkness.</p>

<p>In spite of her loyalty, she could not help contrasting
them in her mind, so greatly to Roma's
disadvantage that she murmured to herself:</p>

<p>"I would give half my fortune if Roma were
like this charming girl!"</p>

<p>She lay on the sofa and talked, while Liane
stroked her aching temples with cool, magnetic
fingers, so enchanting Mrs. Clarke that she
caught them once and pressed them to her lips.</p>

<p>"I love you, dear, you are so sweet and noble.
Bend down your head, let me kiss you for saving
my life!" and Liane's dewy lips gave the longed-for
caress so fervently that it thrilled the lady's
heart with keen pleasure. How cold and reluctant
Roma's lips were, even in her warmest,
most deceitful moods.</p>

<p>But ere the day was far advanced Edmund
Clarke suddenly burst in upon them, pale with
anxiety lest wicked Roma had already harmed
his gentle wife.</p>

<p>He was astonished when he found her in company
with Liane Lester.</p>

<p>Explanations followed, and surprise was succeeded
by delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>He was so sure that Liane was his own daughter
that he longed to clasp her in his arms, kiss
her sweet, rosy lips, and claim her for his own.</p>

<p>But he did not dare risk the shock to his delicate,
nervous wife.</p>

<p>"I must wait a little, till I can get proof to back
up my assertion," he decided, so his greeting to
Liane, though grateful and friendly, was repressed
in its ardor, while he thought gladly:</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven! She has won her way, unaided,
to her mother's heart, and that makes
everything easier. I shall not have to encounter
her opposition in ousting Roma from the place
so long wrongfully occupied."</p>

<p>"Do you know what I am thinking of, Edmund,
dear?" said his wife. "I wish to adopt
Liane for a daughter."</p>

<p>He started with surprise and pleasure, his fine
eyes beaming:</p>

<p>"A happy idea!" he exclaimed; "but do you
think Roma would care for a sister?"</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, then answered:</p>

<p>"Frankly, I do not, but I have fallen so deeply
in love with this dear girl, and she seems already
so necessary to my happiness, that Roma must
yield to my will in the matter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment Liane arose, saying sweetly:</p>

<p>"I am your debtor for a charming day, Mrs.
Clarke, but it is time for me to go now, or my
grandmother will be uneasy about me."</p>

<p>"Then you must promise me to come here again
to-morrow morning; for I shall never let you
work for a living again. Edmund, you must send
her home in the carriage," cried Mrs. Clarke,
kissing her charming guest farewell.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">TREMBLING HOPES.</p>


<p>Mrs. Brinkley was amazed to see Liane coming
home in an elegant carriage, and when she
entered she could not help exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Really, my dear, I shall believe presently that
you and Mistress Jenks must be rich folks in disguise!
Here was your granny receiving a visit
from a grand young lady in a carriage this morning,
and now you coming home in another one,
just when I was expecting you and Lizzie to come
trudging home, afoot, from work. It's rather
strange, I think, and, coupled with your gifts yesterday,
it looks like you were fooling with some
rich young man that means nothing but trifling,
though I hope for your own sake it ain't so!"</p>

<p>There was a sharp note of suspicion in her
voice, but Liane, inured to harshness, dared not
resent it, only shrank sensitively, as from a blow,
and meekly explained the happenings of the day,
giving the bare facts only, but withholding the
promises Mrs. Clarke had made, too incredulous
of good fortune coming to her to make any boast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Brinkley flushed, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"That was a brave thing you did, my dear, and
I want you to excuse me if I hurt your feelings
just now. I spoke for your own good, wishing
to be as careful over your welfare as I am over
my own sister Lizzie's!"</p>

<p>"I understand, and I thank you!" the young
girl answered sweetly, emboldening Mrs. Brinkley
to ask curiously:</p>

<p>"Did the rich lady whose life you saved give
you any reward?"</p>

<p>"She asked me very particularly to return to
the hotel to-morrow, and intimated that I should
not have to work for my living any more!"</p>

<p>"Then your fortune's made, my dear girl. Let
me congratulate you," cried Mrs. Brinkley. "I've
news for you, too. I was lucky enough to secure
two new boarders for my two empty rooms this
morning."</p>

<p>Liane feigned a polite interest, and she added:</p>

<p>"One was a man, a language teacher in a boarding
school. I didn't like his looks much. He is
dark and Spanish looking, but he paid my price in
advance, so that reconciled me to his scowling
brow and black whiskers. The other is a seamstress,
very neat and ladylike, and I believe I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
find her real pleasant. Her name is Sophie Nutter,
and his is Carlos Cisneros."</p>

<p>Liane's eyes brightened as she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There used to be a lady's maid at Cliffdene
named Sophie Nutter. I wonder if it can be the
same?"</p>

<p>"You might make a little call on her and see.
Her room is next yours, and your granny has
gone out to buy some baked beans for her supper."</p>

<p>Liane was glad that granny had not seen her
come home in the carriage, she hated having to
explain everything to the ill-natured old crone,
and she started to go upstairs, but looked back
to ask:</p>

<p>"Who was granny's caller?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. She was in such a bad temper
when she went away, I didn't dare ask. The
young lady was all in silk and fur, with a thick
veil over her face, but some locks of hair peeped
out at the back of her neck, and they were thick
and red as copper. She stayed upstairs with
granny as much as an hour, and when she left
the old woman seemed to be perfectly devilish in
her temper. Seems to me I'd be afraid to live
with her if I was you, Liane!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"So I am, Mrs. Brinkley, but she is old and
poor, and it would be wicked for me to desert
her, you know!"</p>

<p>"I wonder what God leaves such as her in the
world for to torment good people, while He takes
away good, useful ones, that can ill be spared!"
soliloquized the landlady; but Liane sighed without
replying, and, running upstairs, tapped lightly
on the new boarder's door.</p>

<p>It opened quickly, and there were mutual exclamations
of surprise and pleasure. It was, indeed,
the Sophie Nutter of Cliffdene.</p>

<p>"Do come in my room and sit down, Miss Lester.
I'm so proud to see you again!" cried the
former maid.</p>

<p>Liane accepted the invitation, and they spent
half an hour exchanging confidences.</p>

<p>"I saw in a Stonecliff paper that you got the
prize for beauty, and no wonder! You are fairer
than a flower, my dear young lady! But, my
goodness, how mad Miss Roma must have been!
By the way, I saw her getting out of a carriage
here to-day, and she was closeted with your
granny an hour in close conversation. Does she
visit you often?"</p>

<p>"She has never been here before. I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
imagine why she came, but I dare not ask granny
unless she volunteers some information," confessed
Liane, as she started up, exclaiming: "I
hear her coming in now, so I will go and help her
make the tea!"</p>

<p>"Bless you, my sweet young lady, you deserve
a better fate than living with that cross old hag!"
exclaimed Sophie Nutter impulsively.</p>

<p>She was surprised when Liane turned back to
her and said with a sudden ripple of girlish
laughter:</p>

<p>"Sophie, suppose my lot should change? Suppose
Mrs. Clarke should do something grand for
me in return for saving her life to-day? Suppose
I were rich and grand, which it isn't likely I
shall ever be! Could I employ you for my maid?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, my dear Miss Lester, and I
should be proud, and grateful for the chance to
serve such a sweet, kind mistress!" cried Sophie
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, and please consider yourself engaged,
if the improbable happens!" laughed
Liane, in girlish mockery, as she hurried out,
meeting in the hall a dark-browed stranger, from
whom she started back in dismay as he passed
scowlingly to his room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>It was no wonder Liane recoiled in fear and
dislike from Carlos Cisneros, the new boarder.</p>

<p>The sight of his somber, scowling face, with
its dark beard, recalled to her that night upon
the beach when Devereaux had saved her from
a ruffian's insults.</p>

<p>For it was the selfsame face that had scowled
upon her in the moonlight that night. It had terrified
her too much ever to be forgotten.</p>

<p>He had evidently recognized her, too, from his
start of surprise, and the angry bow with which
he passed her by.</p>

<p>Trembling with the surprise of the unpleasant
rencounter, Liane hastened to seclude herself
within her own rooms.</p>

<p>Granny Jenks had just entered, and she was
still in the vilest of humors, glaring murderously
at Liane, without uttering a word, and giving
vent to her temper by banging and slamming
everything within her reach.</p>

<p>Liane, gentle, sorrowful, patient, her young
heart full of the happenings of the day, and tremulous
hopes for the morrow, moved softly about,
laying the cloth for tea on the small table, and
helping as much as the snapping, snarling old
woman would permit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>The sight of her humility and patience ought
to have melted the hardest heart, but Granny
Jenks was implacable. She only saw in the lovely
creature a rival to Roma, and an impediment that
must be swept from her path.</p>

<p>Most exciting had been the interview that day
between granny and her real granddaughter, and
they had mutually agreed that Liane's continued
life was a menace not to be borne longer. The
beautiful, injured girl must die to insure Roma's
continuance in her position.</p>

<p>When Roma left the house a devilish plot had
been laid, whose barest details almost had been
worked out, and the beautiful schemer's heart
throbbed with triumph as she swept out to her
carriage.</p>

<p>She had not noticed, on entering the house, a
dark, scowling face at the parlor window, neither
did she guess that, while she was with granny,
the new boarder went out and slipped into the
carriage, unobserved by the driver, calmly remaining
there and awaiting her return.</p>

<p>When she entered the carriage and seated herself,
looking up the next moment to find herself
opposite Carlos Cisneros, she opened her lips to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
shriek aloud, but his hand closed firmly over her
lips, and his hoarse voice muttered in her ear:</p>

<p>"Scream, and your wicked life shall end with a
bullet in your heart, adventuress, false wife, murderess!"</p>

<p>The driver, unaware of his double fare,
whipped up his horses and drove on, while the
strange pair glared fiercely at each other, the man
hissing savagely:</p>

<p>"I don't know how I keep my hands from your
fair white throat, murderess, unless I am lenient
because I remember burning kisses you once gave
me before your false nature turned from me, and
you fled from the school, where you had wedded
the poor language teacher secretly while I lay ill
of a fever. Cruel heart, to desert me while I was
supposed to be dying!"</p>

<p>"A pity you had not died!" she muttered
viciously between her red lips, and he snarled:</p>

<p>"It is not your fault that I am living! When I
found you, after long, weary search, at Cliffdene,
that night, and you toppled me so madly over the
cliff, I am sure you meant to kill me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I cannot see how I failed!" she muttered.</p>

<p>"If you wish to know, the explanation is easy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
I was picked up more dead than alive by a passing
yacht, and carried to the nearest town, where I
spent weary months in a hospital from the blow I
had received on my head in falling over the bluff.
I have but lately recovered, and came here and
found a position to teach in a school."</p>

<p>"You had wisely concluded to give up your pursuit
of me?" she sneered.</p>

<p>"Yes, discouraged by the warm reception I got
from you at Cliffdene; but, fate having thrown
you across my path again, I believe I ought to
make capital of it. You are my wife secretly, and
you tried to murder me. Both are dangerous secrets.
Perhaps you would pay me well to keep
them?"</p>

<p>"I suppose that I must do so?" Roma answered,
after a moment's hesitancy, with bitter chagrin.</p>

<p>"Very well. I will take what money you have
about you now, and I must know what terms you
will make for my silence. A liberal allowance
monthly would suit me best."</p>

<p>Roma emptied her purse into his hands, saying:</p>

<p>"If we agree upon terms of silence, will you
promise never to molest me again? Not even if
I marry another man!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"I promise! And I pity the fellow who gets
you, if you treat him as you did me!"</p>

<p>"The less you say on that subject the better!
Do not forget that you persuaded an innocent
schoolgirl into a secret marriage, that she was
bound to repent when she came to her sober
senses," she cried bitterly. "But there, it is too
late now for recriminations. I hoped you were
dead, but, since you are not, I wish only to be
rid of you!"</p>

<p>"You can buy my silence!" replied Carlos Cisneros,
so calmly that she congratulated herself,
thinking:</p>

<p>"He is not going to be dangerous, after all."</p>

<p>Aloud, she said:</p>

<p>"I will arrange to send you a monthly allowance
of fifty dollars, the best I can do for you!
Will that satisfy your greed?"</p>

<p>"It is very little, but I will accept it," he replied
sullenly.</p>

<p>"Very well; now leave me, if you can do so
without attracting the driver's attention. I shall
be leaving the carriage at the next corner," she
said, and he obeyed her, springing lightly to the
ground, and disappearing.</p>

<p>"He was not very violent, thank goodness!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
sighed Roma, believing that as long as she paid
him he would not betray her dangerous secrets;
but bitterly chagrined that he was not dead, as
she had believed so long.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can compass that later!" she
thought darkly, as she gave the order to the
driver for Commonwealth Avenue.</p>

<p>She had determined to call on Lyde Carrington,
with whom she had a society acquaintance,
in the hope of seeing Jesse Devereaux again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carrington received her with graceful
cordiality, and Roma proceeded to make herself
irresistible, in the hope of getting an invitation
to remain a few days.</p>

<p>"I shall have to remain in Boston several days
to have my teeth treated by a dentist, but mamma
is compelled to return to Cliffdene to-night. I
think of sending for my maid to cheer my loneliness,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Come and stay with me," cried Lyde, falling
into the trap.</p>

<p>She knew that Jesse had been engaged to the
dashing heiress, and amiably thought that their
near proximity to each other might effect a reconciliation.</p>

<p>She had a shrewd suspicion of Roma's object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
in coming; but she did not disapprove of it; she
was so anxious to see him married to the proper
person, a rich girl in their own set. She knew
he was romantic at heart, and secretly feared he
might make a msalliance.</p>

<p>But even while she was thinking these thoughts
she remembered Liane, and said to herself:</p>

<p>"If my pretty glove girl were rich and well-born,
I should choose her above all others as a
bride for my handsome brother!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WHEN HAPPINESS SEEMED NEAR!</p>


<p>Granny Jenks, after great bustling about and
clattering of dishes, sat down at last to copious
draughts of strong tea, flavored with whisky.</p>

<p>"Oh, granny, aren't you taking a drop too
much?" ventured Liane apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Mind your own business, girl. I'll take as
much as I choose! Ay, and pour some down your
throat, too, if you don't look out!"</p>

<p>Liane drank her tea in silence, while the old
woman went on angrily:</p>

<p>"I want that forty dollars you kept back from
me, girl, and I mean to have it, too, or give you
a beating!"</p>

<p>This was a frequent threat, so Liane did not
pay much heed, she only gazed fixedly at the old
hag, and said:</p>

<p>"Granny, suppose I were to go away and leave
you forever, do you think you could be happy
without me?"</p>

<p>"Humph! And why not, pray?"</p>

<p>Liane sighed, and answered:</p>

<p>"I was just thinking how I have been your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
slave, beaten and cuffed like a dog for eighteen
years, and I was wondering if in all that time,
when I have been so patient and you so cruel, if
you had in your heart one spark of love for your
miserable grandchild!"</p>

<p>"Eh?" cried granny, staring at her fixedly,
while Liane continued:</p>

<p>"Ever since I could toddle I have labored at
your bidding, fetching and carrying, with nothing,
but scoldings and beatings in return, and not a
gleam of sunshine in my poor life. You have not
shown me either mercy or pity; you have made
my whole life as wretched as possible, and I have
sometimes wondered why Heaven has permitted
my sufferings to continue so long. Now, I have
a strange feeling, as if somehow it was all coming
to an end, and I wonder if you will miss me, and
regret your unnatural conduct, when I am gone
out of your life forever?"</p>

<p>She spoke with such sweet, grave seriousness
that the old woman regarded her earnestly,
noting, as she had never closely done before, the
beauty and sweetness of the young eyes turned
upon her with such pathetic solemnity.</p>

<p>"Maybe you mean to run away with some rascal,
like your mother!" she sneered at length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was not thinking of any man, or of running
away, granny; only, it seems to me, there's a
change coming into my life, and I am going out
of yours forever!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean you're going to die?"</p>

<p>"No, granny, I mean that I shall be happy,
after all these wretched years; that my starved
heart will be fed on love and kindness, and I want
to tell you now that if Heaven grants me the
blessings I look for, I shall leave you that forty
dollars as a gift, for then I shall not need it," returned
Liane solemnly.</p>

<p>"Better give it here, now; you might forget
when your luck comes to you. And&mdash;and, you
ain't never going to need it after to-night, anyway!"
returned granny, with a ghastly grin.</p>

<p>"No, I prefer to wait till to-morrow!" the
young girl answered, with a sudden start of fear,
for the glare the old woman fixed on her was positively
murderous.</p>

<p>She got up, thinking she would go down and
see if Lizzie had returned from her work yet;
but granny sprang from her chair and adroitly
turned the key in the lock, standing with her back
against the door.</p>

<p>Liane's eyes flashed with impatience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me out, granny!" she cried. "This is not
fair!"</p>

<p>"Give me that money!" grumbled the hag, with
the tone and look of a wild beast.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;Mrs. Brinkley put it in a savings bank
for me!" faltered Liane, bracing herself for defense,
for her startled eyes suddenly saw murder
in the old woman's face.</p>

<p>She felt all at once as if she would have given
worlds to be outside that locked door, away from
the deadly peril that menaced her in the beastly
eyes of half-drunken granny.</p>

<p>She was not a coward. Yesterday she had
faced death bravely for Mrs. Clarke's sake, and
would have given her life freely for another's;
but this was different.</p>

<p>To be murdered by the old hag who had blasted
all her young life, just as her hopes of happiness
seemed about to be realized, oh, it was horrible!
Unrelenting fate seemed to pursue her to the last.</p>

<p>She drew back with a gasping cry, for the old
woman was upon her with the growl of a wild
beast and the well-remembered spring of many
a former combat, when the weak went down before
the strong.</p>

<p>Liane, who had always been too gentle to strike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
back before, now realized that she must fight for
her life. Granny intended to kill her this time,
she felt instinctively, and silently prayed
Heaven's aid.</p>

<p>She opened her lips to shriek and alarm the
household, but granny's skinny claw closed over
her mouth before she could utter a sound, and
then a most unequal struggle ensued.</p>

<p>Liane was no match for the old tigress, who
scratched, and bit, and tore with fury, finally
snatching up a club that she had provided for the
occasion, and striking the girl on her head, so that
she went down like a log to the floor.</p>

<p>Granny Jenks snarled like a hyena, and stooped
down over her mutilated victim.</p>

<p>She lay white and breathless on the floor, her
pallid face marked with blood stains, not a breath
stirring her young bosom, and the fiend growled
viciously:</p>

<p>"Dead as a doornail, and out of my pretty
Roma's way forever!"</p>

<p>Suddenly there came the loud shuffling of feet
in the hall, and the pounding of eager fists on the
locked door.</p>

<p>Granny Jenks started in wild alarm. She realized
that the sounds of her struggle had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
heard, and regretted her precipitate onslaught
on Liane.</p>

<p>"I should have waited till they were all asleep;
but that whisky fired my blood too soon!" she
muttered, as, paying no heed to the outside
clamor, she dragged the limp body of her lovely
victim to the inner room, throwing it on the bed
and drawing the covers over it, leaving a part of
her face exposed in a natural way, as if she were
asleep.</p>

<p>She was running a terrible risk of detection
but nothing but bravado could save her now.</p>

<p>She dimmed the light, and returned to the other
room, demanding:</p>

<p>"Who is there? What do you want?"</p>

<p>Several angry voices vociferated:</p>

<p>"Let us in! You are beating Liane!"</p>

<p>At that she snarled in rage and threw wide the
door, confronting Mrs. Brinkley and her sister,
with the two new boarders.</p>

<p>"You must be crazy!" she exclaimed. "I was
pounding a nail into the wall to hang my petticoat
on, and Liane is asleep in the bedroom. If
you don't believe me, go and look!"</p>

<p>They did not believe her, so they tiptoed to the
door and peeped inside, and there, indeed, lay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
girl, seeming in the dim half light to be sleeping
sweetly and naturally.</p>

<p>"You can wake her if you choose, but she said
she was very tired, and hoped I would not disturb
her to-night," said artful granny coolly, though in
a terrible fright lest she be taken at her word.</p>

<p>They retreated in something like shamefaced
confusion, leaving granny mistress of the situation.</p>

<p>"What made you so sure she was beating the
girl?" asked Carlos Cisneros of Sophie Nutter,
who had raised the alarm.</p>

<p>"I used to know them at Stonecliff, where they
lived, and she beat her there, poor thing, so when
I heard the noise I thought she was at her old
tricks again!" replied Sophie, going back downstairs
to the parlor, where she had been looking
at Mrs. Brinkley's photographs.</p>

<p>The language teacher followed her, and as he
was rather handsome, and knew how to be fascinating
with women, he soon gained her confidence,
and found out everything she knew about
Stonecliff, even to the cause of her leaving Roma
Clarke's service. His eyes gleamed with interest
as she added earnestly:</p>

<p>"Although I have seen Mr. Devereaux alive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
since, and they tell me I was raving crazy that
night, still I can never be persuaded that I did not
see Miss Clarke push a man over the bluff to his
death."</p>

<p>She was astounded when he answered coolly:</p>

<p>"You were not mistaken, but the man was not
Devereaux. It was another, who held a dangerous
secret of hers, so that she wanted him dead."</p>

<p>Sophie looked at him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Did you see her push him over the bluff as I
did? Ugh! That horrible scene! It comes before
me now, as plain as if it was that night!" she
shuddered.</p>

<p>She was amazed when he answered:</p>

<p>"I was the man she tried to drown!"</p>

<p>He was secretly delighted that there had been
a witness to Roma's crime. It made his hold upon
her that much firmer.</p>

<p>He added, in reply to Sophie's gasp of wonder:</p>

<p>"I was saved by a passing yacht, and put in a
hospital, where I nearly died from a wound on my
head."</p>

<p>Sophie gasped out:</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and aren't you going to punish the
hussy?"</p>

<p>His eyes flashed, but he answered carelessly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, not just yet!"</p>

<p>"Shall you ever?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see," he replied. "Can you imagine
what brought her into this house to-day?"</p>

<p>"I cannot. I suppose she knew Granny Jenks
at Stonecliff; but I am sure she hated sweet Liane,
because she carried off the beauty prize over her
head."</p>

<p>Carlos Cisneros gleaned all he could from
Sophie, but he gave her no further information
about himself, content with making a very good
impression, indeed, on Sophie's rather susceptible
heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, upstairs, granny, having locked the
door with a stifled oath, dropped down on the rug,
and lay for long hours in a drunken stupor, while
the dreary night wore on.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the bells hoarsely clanged four in
the morning, granny started broad awake, shivering
with cold in the fireless room, and sat up and
looked about her, whimpering like a startled
child:</p>

<p>"Liane! Liane!"</p>

<p>A sudden comprehension seemed to dawn upon
her, and, getting up heavily, she stalked into the
inner room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>The dim lamp was burning low, casting eerie
shadows about the room, and she walked over to
the bed, where she had thrown something the
evening before.</p>

<p>The ghastly thing lay there still, just as she
had placed it with the coverlid drawn up to the
chin, the silent lips fallen apart, the eyes a little
open and staring dully, as granny placed her
skinny claw over the heart, feeling for a pulsation.</p>

<p>There was none. She had done her work well.
Her victim&mdash;the victim of eighteen years of most
barbarous cruelty&mdash;lay pale and motionless before
her, the mute lips uttering no reproach for
her crime.</p>

<p>The old woman gazed and gazed, as if she
could never get done looking, and then her face
changed, her lips twitched, she blinked her eyelids
nervously, and sank down by the bed, overcome
by a sudden and terrible remorse.</p>

<p>"My God! What have I done?" she groaned
self-reproachfully.</p>

<p>Far back in granny's life was a time when
she had been a better woman. It seemed to return
upon her now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>She groped beneath the coverlid for Liane's
cold, stiff hand.</p>

<p>"Liane, little angel, I am sorry," she muttered.
"I would bring you back if I could! Oh, why did
the foul fiend send her here to tempt me to the
damnation of this deed? But she is safe now!
Roma is safe now! And she has promised that
I shall not miss Liane's labor."</p>

<p>A new thought struck her. It would soon be
day, and she must hasten to hide the evidence of
her crime.</p>

<p>She started up nervously, and busied herself
searching Liane for the coveted money, but not
finding it, she began other necessary preparations.</p>

<p>It was that dismal hour that comes before the
dawn, when she stole through Mrs. Brinkley's
dark halls and passed like a shadow through the
side door, escaping safely into the street with a
shawled and hooded burden that must be safely
hidden from the sight of men.</p>

<p>Lightly and softly fell the cold December snow,
covering up the footprints of the skulking
woman; but they could not blot the dark stain
of crime from her black soul.</p>

<p>Dawn came slowly, and broadened into perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
day, and in the Brinkley house the household
stirred and went about accustomed tasks. Soon
granny's voice went snarling through the open
door, calling shrilly downstairs:</p>

<p>"Liane! Liane!"</p>

<p>Lizzie White answered back from the kitchen:</p>

<p>"She is not here!"</p>

<p>Then granny tapped on Miss Nutter's door.</p>

<p>"Is that lazy baggage in here?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen her since last night," answered
Sophie, and presently the house rang with
granny's cries of anger and distress.</p>

<p>All went in haste to her rooms, and she reported
that Liane had certainly run away, as she
had many times threatened to do. All her clothes
and little trinkets, together with her little hand
bag, were missing.</p>

<p>Granny's blended anger and grief were so superbly
acted that her simple listeners did not
doubt her truth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brinkley, thinking of the fine presents
Liane had received from some unknown admirer,
secretly doubted the story the girl had told her,
and confided to Lizzie her belief that she had indeed
eloped, and would most likely come to a
bad end.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A SWORD THRUST IN HIS HEART.</p>


<p>A hopeless love must always evoke pity in a
generous mind. Devereaux could not help being
touched when he found Roma installed as his sister's
guest, and comprehended that it was love for
himself that had brought her there.</p>

<p>Men, even the bravest and strongest, are pitiably
susceptible to woman's flattery. Roma's persistent
love, faithful through all the repulses it
had received, was a subtle flattery that touched
Devereaux's heart, cruelly wounded by Liane's
rejection, and made him think better of himself
again.</p>

<p>Roma brought all the batteries of her fascination
to bear on her recreant lover that first evening,
and he submitted to be amused with charming
grace, that thrilled her with renewed hope.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carrington, too, lent her womanly aid to
further the little byplay she saw going on between
the estranged lovers. She knew that propinquity
is a great thing in such a case, and believed that a
reconciliation was certain. Of course, she did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
know that Devereaux's heart belonged to Liane,
or she would not have been so confident.</p>

<p>Roma telegraphed for her maid the next morning,
fully resolved to make the most of her visit,
and after breakfast, when she saw Devereaux
preparing to go out, in spite of her blandishments,
she asked him to call on her mother at the hotel,
and tell her that she would be Mrs. Carrington's
guest during her short stay.</p>

<p>She was more than ever determined to marry
the young millionaire now, and thus make her
position in life secure, even if by any untoward
accident she should be ousted from her place as
the Clarkes' daughter and heiress.</p>

<p>Devereaux promised to do as she asked, and
sallied forth, in reality tired of Roma's company,
though too polite to show it.</p>

<p>About the middle of the day he called at Mrs.
Clarke's hotel to convey Roma's message, and was
surprised to find her father there also.</p>

<p>They greeted him most cordially, and Mrs.
Clarke exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Is it not tedious, waiting by the hour for a
caller who never comes?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean your daughter?" he asked,
hastening to deliver Roma's message.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then she has not heard of my accident yet?"
exclaimed the lady.</p>

<p>"No!" he replied, and with unwonted animation
she hastened to pour out the whole story of
yesterday.</p>

<p>She did not spare herself in the least, frankly
describing her pride and hauteur.</p>

<p>"I will not deny that I was vexed and jealous,
and hated her because she had rivaled Roma for
the beauty prize," she confessed. "I am ashamed
of it now, and bitterly repented after learning her
angelic sweetness and nobility of heart."</p>

<p>Devereaux's heart thrilled with joy at these
generous praises of lovely Liane, and he listened
in eager silence to all Mrs. Clarke had to say,
glad, indeed, that she proposed to adopt the girl,
but wondering much if Roma would agree to the
plan.</p>

<p>"So, then, it is Miss Lester you are awaiting?"
he said, with a quickened heart throb.</p>

<p>"Yes; and I think it most strange that she has
not kept her promise to come here early this
morning. If I knew her address, I should have
gone long ago to her house, but, unfortunately I
forgot to ask it," sighed Mrs. Clarke, while her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
husband listened to everything with a glad, eager
face.</p>

<p>"I wrote you, Mr. Clarke, two days ago, sending
you her address, which I had myself just discovered,"
said Devereaux, looking at him.</p>

<p>"That is very strange. I did not receive it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it had not been delivered when you
left home."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so."</p>

<p>"And," pursued Devereaux, with a crimson
flush mounting up to his brow at thought of seeing
the dearest of his heart again, "if I can serve
you in doing so, I will go and bring Miss Lester
here to see you. It may be her excessive modesty
that keeps her away."</p>

<p>They fairly jumped at his offer, and he hurried
away, most eager, indeed, to do them this favor,
glad in his heart of this grand opportunity for
poor Liane.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke looked at her husband, with a half
sigh tempering her soft smile.</p>

<p>She exclaimed:</p>

<p>"He is in love with that charming girl! Could
you not see it? Alas, for my poor Roma!"</p>

<p>"Roma scarcely deserves our sympathy in the
matter. She lost him by her own folly," Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Clarke replied impatiently, and the subject was
dropped. He did not care to discuss Roma with
his heart full of his own dear child.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Devereaux took a carriage to
Liane's humble abode, full of a joy he could not
repress at thought of seeing Liane again.</p>

<p>But he sighed to himself:</p>

<p>"I shall feel guilty in her presence, because I
was indirectly the means of her losing Malcolm
Dean! Ah, had she but loved me instead, what
happiness would be mine instead of this aching
loneliness of heart."</p>

<p>When he alighted at Mrs. Brinkley's door and
rang the bell, the small family, excepting a servant,
was out, and a neat maid answered the ring.</p>

<p>"Miss Lester?" with a comprehensive grin.
"Oh, sir, she beant here! She runned away last
night with her beau!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>It was like a sword thrust quivering in his
heart, those sudden words. He grew pale, and
stared at her, muttering:</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"But, sir, it's true as gospel! And her poor
granny is in a fine taking over it, too. She says
as how Liane was cruel to go off so, and leave her
in poverty to end her days in the poorhouse!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is the old woman? I should like to see
her," he said dismally, hoping for some light.</p>

<p>"She's out, sir, looking for the girl, swearing to
kill the man as persuaded her off."</p>

<p>"And the family?"</p>

<p>"All out, sir. Mrs. Brinkley went to market,
and her sister Lizzie to the store, where she and
Liane worked."</p>

<p>Devereaux pressed a dollar into the good-natured
servant's hand, and stumbled back to the
carriage, almost blind with pain from this sudden
stroke of fate.</p>

<p>The servant looked after him with mingled
wonder, admiration, and gratitude, and describing
him afterward to the family, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The prettiest man I ever saw in my life&mdash;coal-black
eyes and hair, straight nose, dimple in his
chin, slim, white hands, diamond ring, good
clothes, fit to kill! He must 'ave been another of
Liane's beaus, for, when I told him she had
eloped, he turned white as a corpse, and kind of
staggered, like I had hit him in the face. But he
didn't forget his company manners, for he bowed
like a prince and put a whole silver dollar in my
hand as he went back to his carriage."</p>

<p>"That sounds like Jesse Devereaux, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Clarke's lover!" cried Sophie Nutter, and Mrs.
Brinkley said quickly:</p>

<p>"Well, Liane knew that man, and was in love
with him, but he snubbed her with the proudest
bow I ever saw, one day when we passed by his
grand home on Commonwealth Avenue."</p>

<p>"So he lives on Commonwealth Avenue!" remarked
Carlos Cisneros, with a flash of his somber,
black eyes. He was thinking of the house
he had followed Roma's carriage to yesterday&mdash;the
palatial mansion on Commonwealth Avenue.</p>

<p>"So she is there at my rival's house, and she
dares to think I will let her marry him! And I
have two scores to settle with the handsome Devereaux!"
he thought.</p>

<p>Devereaux could scarcely believe the terrible
news.</p>

<p>He hoped there might be some mistake, and he
determined to go to the store and see if she might
not be there.</p>

<p>But there were no pansy-blue eyes smiling over
the glove counter, but a pair of sparkling black
ones, whose owner smiled.</p>

<p>"Miss Lester? No; she is not here to-day. I
cannot tell you anything about her; but there's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
her friend, Miss White, you can ask her&mdash;Lizzie!"</p>

<p>Lizzie White hurried forward, but she could
tell him no more than he had already heard.</p>

<p>She wondered whom the handsome stranger
could be, but she was too timid to ask his name,
only she thought within herself that he must
surely be in love with Liane, he was so pale and
disturbed looking.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that he was most loath to accept
the theory that the girl had gone away with
a lover.</p>

<p>"Is there no possibility she has run away alone
to escape her grandmother's cruelty?" he insisted.</p>

<p>Lizzie said she could not tell, she had never
heard Liane mention any man's name, but she
had been more confidential with her mother.</p>

<p>"Could you&mdash;would you&mdash;tell me her lover's
name?" he pleaded; but Lizzie answered that it
would not be right to betray her friend's confidence.</p>

<p>"He was a rich young man, and not likely to
marry my poor friend," she added sorrowfully,
and after that admission he could extract no more
from Lizzie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>With a sad heart he returned to the Clarkes'
with his ill news.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke was terribly excited:</p>

<p>"I will not believe she has gone with any man!
I should sooner believe that that old hag has made
way with the girl! Give me the address, Devereaux,
and I will go and wring the truth from
her black heart, if you will stay and cheer my wife
while I am gone!" he exclaimed, springing up in
passionate excitement.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE BRIDAL.</p>


<p>Dolly Dorr arrived duly that afternoon at the
Devereaux mansion, her little head full of fancies
as vain as Roma's&mdash;both dreaming of winning
the same man.</p>

<p>But when Dolly saw her hero's magnificent
home her hopes began to fall a little. She began
to comprehend that there were heights she could
not reach. Miss Roma would be sure to get him
back now&mdash;of course, she had come there for that
purpose.</p>

<p>Dolly felt as angry and disappointed as was
possible to one of her limited brain capacity, but
she hid her feelings and tried to attend to her
various duties as Roma's maid.</p>

<p>She saw that her mistress was subtly changed
since she had left Cliffdene. A harrowing anxiety
gleamed in her eyes, and when they were
alone Roma was more irritable than she had ever
seen her before.</p>

<p>The reason was not far to seek. Jesse Devereaux
had returned a while ago with news that
nearly drove her mad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the story of her mother's rescue yesterday
by Liane Lester, and the consequent resolve
to adopt Liane as a daughter.</p>

<p>Roma listened to him with the most fixed attention;
she did not move or speak, but sat dumbly
with her great, shining eyes fixed on his face,
drinking in every word with the most eager attention.</p>

<p>Inwardly she was furious, outwardly calm and
interested, and at the last she said, with marvelous
sweetness:</p>

<p>"You have almost taken my breath away with
surprise. So I am to have a sister to dispute my
reign over papa's and mamma's hearts! How
shall I bear it?"</p>

<p>He was astonished at the equanimity she displayed.
She had a better heart than he had
thought.</p>

<p>"So you do not care?" he exclaimed curiously.</p>

<p>"What does it matter whether I care or not?
No one loves poor Roma now!" she sighed, with a
glance of sad reproach.</p>

<p>The conversation had taken a reproachful turn,
and he adroitly changed it.</p>

<p>"But I had not told you all. Your parents'
good intentions must come to naught, for the reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
that Miss Lester went away mysteriously last
night, and the cause of her disappearance is supposed
to be an elopement."</p>

<p>"Oh! With whom?"</p>

<p>Roma's attempt at surprise was not very successful.</p>

<p>"No one knows," he replied, and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"How sorry poor mamma will be!"</p>

<p>"And you?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>Roma had drawn so close to him that she could
speak in an undertone. She locked her jeweled
fingers nervously together now in her lap, and
lifted her great eyes to his, full of piercing reproach,
murmuring sadly:</p>

<p>"It does not matter to me either way, Jesse. I
have lost interest in everything, now that you
have turned against me!"</p>

<p>It was most embarrassing, her pathetic grief,
and it touched his manly heart with deepest pity.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, I am sorry you take our
estrangement so hardly! Believe me, I have not
turned against you, as you think. I am still sincerely
your friend," he answered, most kindly.</p>

<p>But the great red-brown eyes searched his face
with passion.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jesse, I do not want your friendship! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
want your love&mdash;the love I threw away in the
madness of a moment! Give it back to me!" she
cried, with outstretched hands pleading to him.</p>

<p>Impulsively he took one of the jeweled hands
in his, holding it nervously yet kindly while he
said:</p>

<p>"It is cruel kindness to undeceive you, Roma,
but I cannot let you go on hoping for what can
never be! You never had my heart's love, Roma.
It was only an ephemeral fancy that is long since
dead. I thought you wished to flirt with me, and
I entered into it with languid amusement. Somehow&mdash;I
never can quite understand how&mdash;I
drifted into a proposal. I regretted it directly
afterward, and realized that my heart was not
really interested. You broke our engagement,
and I was glad of it. Forgive my frankness and
let us be friends!"</p>

<p>But her face dropped into her hands with a
choking sob, her whole frame shaking with emotion,
and he could only gaze upon her in silent
sympathy, feeling himself a brute that he could
not give the love she craved.</p>

<p>Roma remained several moments in this attitude
of hopeless grief, then, rising with her handkerchief
to her eyes, glided slowly past him&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
slowly that he might have clasped her in outstretched
arms had he chosen.</p>

<p>But he remained mute and motionless, sorrow
and sympathy in his heart, but nothing more.</p>

<p>Sobbing forlornly, Roma passed him by, and
went to her own room.</p>

<p>There Dolly had an exhibition of her imperious
temper, culminating in a threat to slap her face.</p>

<p>Dolly's quick temper flamed up, and she retorted
fiercely:</p>

<p>"Slap me if you dare, and I'll leave your service
on the spot! Yes, and I'll go and tell Mr. Devereaux
the fate of his letter to Liane Lester, too!
I&mdash;I&mdash;wish I hadn't never had anything to do
with you, either. I'm sorry I treated sweet Liane
so mean! She was a heap nicer than you!"</p>

<p>Roma turned around quickly, holding out a
pretty ring with a little diamond in it.</p>

<p>"Don't leave me, Dolly; at least, not yet," she
sighed mournfully. "I'm sorry I was cross to
you. Forgive me, and let's be friends again.
Take this little ring to remember me, for I shall
never need it after to-night!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Miss Roma?" cried the
girl, slipping the ring coquettishly over her finger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
but Roma threw herself face downward on a sofa
without replying.</p>

<p>Dolly went into another room to arrange the
clothes she had brought her mistress, and to admire
herself occasionally in a long pier glass, and
so the time slipped past, and in the gloaming
Roma's voice called faintly:</p>

<p>"Dolly!"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss."</p>

<p>Roma was standing up, very pale, very tragic-looking,
by the couch, in her hands a letter and a
tiny vial of colored liquid.</p>

<p>"Dolly, you are to take this letter to Mr. Devereaux
and ask his sister to come with him to
my room. Tell them both I have swallowed
poison, and shall be dead in a few minutes!"</p>

<p>Dolly snatched the letter and ran shrieking
from the room, while Roma sank back on the
couch, her eyes half closed, her face death-white,
the vial of poison, half drained, clasped in her
fingers.</p>

<p>Devereaux tore open the letter, and read the
single line it contained:</p>

<p>"I cannot live without your love! I have taken
poison!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>He and Mrs. Carrington almost flew upstairs
after hurriedly telephoning for a physician.</p>

<p>They knelt by her couch, reproaching her for
her rashness, declaring that they had sent for a
physician to save her life.</p>

<p>"It is useless. I will not take an antidote. I am
determined to die!" she replied stubbornly, and
looked at Devereaux reproachfully, while Lyde
caught her hands, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Oh, Jesse, why couldn't you love her and make
up with her, so that she needn't have been driven
to this?"</p>

<p>Encouraged by this outburst of sympathy,
Roma whispered audibly in her ear:</p>

<p>"If he would only make me his wife, I could
die happy!"</p>

<p>"Do you hear?" nodded Lyde to her brother.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I have dreamed of it so long. I have loved
him so well, I cannot be happy even beyond the
grave unless I can call him my husband once before
I die!" sobbed Roma piteously, and by her
labored breathing and spasms of pain it seemed as
if each moment must be her last.</p>

<p>"Give her her dying wish lest she haunt you!"
whispered the nervous, frightened Lyde.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>Roma's sufferings grew so extreme that his
reluctance yielded to pity. He bowed assent, and
hurried from the room to summon a minister.</p>

<p>The physician entered in haste, but Roma repulsed
him.</p>

<p>"Stand back! I will not take an antidote! I
am already dying!" she screamed.</p>

<p>He caught the vial from her fingers.</p>

<p>"How much have you taken?"</p>

<p>"The bottle was full&mdash;and you see what is
left!"</p>

<p>"Then God have mercy on your soul. I am
powerless to save you from your own rash act,
poor girl, even if you permitted me to try. Why
have you done this dreadful thing?"</p>

<p>"A quarrel with my lover!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is true," sobbed Lyde. "She and Jesse
quarreled, and she rashly swallowed the poison."</p>

<p>She added chokingly:</p>

<p>"They&mdash;they&mdash;are going to be married presently.
Please stay to the ceremony."</p>

<p>Jesse Devereaux entered at that moment with a
minister.</p>

<p>Roma was moaning in pain, her eyes half
closed.</p>

<p>"Can you do nothing, doctor?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas, no! She must be dead in a few minutes!"</p>

<p>He bent down and took her hand.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Roma?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes! Heaven bless you, dear!"</p>

<p>The ceremony began in its simplest form, the
minister standing close by the couch to catch the
faint responses of the dying girl. They were uttered
clearly and audibly, with a faint ring of joy
in the accents, very different from Devereaux's
low, reluctant tones:</p>

<p>Then the minister said solemnly:</p>

<p>"I pronounce you man and wife!"</p>

<p class="chaptitle">BEFORE THE DAWN.</p>


<p>None could envy Edmund Clarke's feelings as
he hastened on his way to find out the fate of the
fair girl he believed to be his daughter!</p>

<p>He could not credit the story of her elopement.</p>

<p>Harrowing suspicion pointed to the probability
that Roma, having found out the truth about herself,
had hurried to Boston to have the real heiress
put out of the way.</p>

<p>What more likely than that the wicked girl had
intercepted Jesse's letter containing Liane's address
and made capital of it to further her own
evil ends?</p>

<p>The man shuddered as he realized what a fiend
he had cherished as his daughter. He realized
that it was the old fable of warming a viper in the
bosom that stings and wounds the succoring
hand.</p>

<p>Roma could never come under his roof again.
Her vile attempt on his life and Doctor Jay's precluded
such a possibility.</p>

<p>But he groaned aloud as he thought of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
to break all the truth to his frail, delicate wife&mdash;unless
he should be able to first find Liane and get
the proofs of her real parentage.</p>

<p>With a trembling hand he rang Mrs. Brinkley's
bell, starting back in surprise when it was answered
by no less a person than Sophie Nutter.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clarke!" she faltered, in blended surprise
and pleasure.</p>

<p>"Sophie!" he exclaimed, following her into the
little parlor, as she said:</p>

<p>"Come in, sir. All the folks are out but me,
and I must say I am as much surprised to see you
here to-day as I was to see Miss Roma yesterday."</p>

<p>Artful Sophie, she distrusted Roma, and took
this method to find out if he knew of his proud
daughter's goings-on.</p>

<p>"Roma here yesterday!" he exclaimed, in a
voice of agony, feeling all his suspicions confirmed.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, she was here to see old Mistress
Jenks yesterday, and spent an hour with her!" returned
Sophie quickly, scenting some sort of a
sensation in the air.</p>

<p>She saw him grow pale as death, and he almost
groaned:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>"Liane? Where was she?"</p>

<p>"At her work, sir, at the store."</p>

<p>"Where is she now?"</p>

<p>"It is thought she has run away with some rich
young man, sir. She is missing this morning, and
all her clothes gone!"</p>

<p>"The old woman&mdash;where is she? I must see
her at once!"</p>

<p>"Lordy, sir, the poor old creature ain't here this
afternoon. She went out to look for Liane, vowing
to kill the fellow that persuaded her away!"</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke had always liked Sophie when she
was a member of his household. Her kind, intelligent
face invited confidence.</p>

<p>"Do you think that her distress was genuine,
or was she playing a part?" he asked, adding:
"To be frank with you, Sophie, I have a deep and
friendly interest in Liane Lester, and I suspect
foul play on the old woman's part."</p>

<p>It needed but this to make Sophie pour out all
that she knew of the old hag's cruelties to Liane
up to last night, when the sounds of a supposed
scuffle had penetrated to her ears, causing the
family to intrude on the old woman en masse, to
find that granny had only been driving a nail,
and that Liane was asleep in bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>"You saw her asleep?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; we all tiptoed to the door, and she lay
peacefully in bed, with the covers drawn up to her
chin."</p>

<p>"You are sure that she was breathing?" he
asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir&mdash;but&mdash;my God, do you think
there could have been anything wrong?" cried
Sophie, alarmed by his looks.</p>

<p>He answered in a voice of anguish:</p>

<p>"I suspect that you were looking at the corpse
of sweet Liane; I suspect that the noise you heard
was old granny beating her to death, and that she
has hidden the dead away, and put out a hideous
lie to account for her disappearance!"</p>

<p>Sophie was so terrified that she burst into violent
weeping.</p>

<p>But Edmund Clarke's face wore the calmness
of a terrible despair. He felt now that Liane had
been foully murdered, and that nothing remained
to him but to take the most complete vengeance
on her murderers.</p>

<p>He exclaimed hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Do not weep so bitterly, my good girl; tears
will not bring back the dead. All that remains
to us now is to take vengeance on her enemies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
To do this we must find proofs of their crime.
Come with me, and let us search Granny Jenks'
room."</p>

<p>It was not hard to break open the locked door,
and they went into the gloomy apartments, Sophie
opening the window and letting in a flood of light.</p>

<p>Then she saw what had escaped their eyes last
night&mdash;stains of blood on the bare, uncarpeted
floor. In the bedroom, the pillow where Liane's
head had rested last night was also marked by red
stains that told in their own mute language the
story of a terrible crime.</p>

<p>Their horrified eyes met, and he groaned:</p>

<p>"It is as I told you! She was murdered, sweet
Liane! Oh, I will take a terrible vengeance for
the crime!"</p>

<p>Sophie replied with heartbroken sobbing, and
they remained thus several moments, shuddering
with horror in the bare, fireless room.</p>

<p>But not a tear dimmed the man's eyes. He was
stricken with despair that lay too deep for tears.
His heavy eyes wandered about the room, lighting
on a small black trunk in a corner.</p>

<p>"If I could only find the proofs!" he muttered,
and unhesitatingly broke the lock, scattering the
contents out upon the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>It was filled with yellowing relics of a bygone
day, and he turned them over rapidly, saying to
Sophie:</p>

<p>"I am searching for something to prove a suspicion
of mine&mdash;a suspicion of a deadly wrong!"</p>

<p>She dried her eyes and looked on with womanly
curiosity, while he picked up and shook a little
red box in the bottom of the trunk.</p>

<p>A dozen or two trinkets and letters fell out on
the floor, and he searched them eagerly over,
lighting at last on a slender golden necklace belonging
to an infant.</p>

<p>He held it with a shaking hand, saying to
Sophie:</p>

<p>"See this little clasp forming in small diamonds
the word 'Baby'? It belonged to my wife in infancy,
and when our little Roma was born she
clasped it on her neck."</p>

<p>"And Granny Jenks has stolen it!" she cried
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Worse than that! She stole also the child that
wore it!" he answered, with a burst of the bitterest
despair.</p>

<p>His heart was breaking with its burden of concealed
misery, and Sophie's eager, respectful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
sympathy drew him on till he could not resist the
temptation to tell her all, sure of her sympathy.</p>

<p>It was like reading a novel to Sophie&mdash;the story
of the lost babe, the spurious one substituted, and
all that had happened since to the present moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear sir, I believe you are quite right!
Sweet, beautiful Liane was surely your daughter,
while as for the other, she never had the ways
of a lady, for all her grand bringing up, and she
had the same cruel spirit like granny, always
wanting to beat any one who displeased her. She
slapped my face several times when I was her
maid, and maybe you know, sir, that I left her
service because I saw her push a man over the
cliff one night."</p>

<p>"I have heard it whispered that you fancied
something of the kind. My wife said you were
crazy," returned Mr. Clarke.</p>

<p>"Crazy&mdash;not a bit of it, sir! It was God's holy
truth! I can show you the man! He escaped the
death she doomed him to, and lives in this very
house!" cried Sophie, glad that she could defend
herself.</p>

<p>"I should like to see the man!" cried Clarke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
who was eager to get all the evidence possible
against Roma.</p>

<p>"He will be coming in directly from his school,"
cried Sophie; and, indeed, at that moment a step
was heard in the hall, and the dark, bearded face
of the new boarder appeared passing the door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" called Sophie imperatively, and as
he obeyed: "Mr. Clarke, this is Carlos Cisneros,
the man Miss Roma pushed over the bluff."</p>

<p>Cisneros bowed to the stranger and scowled
at the informer.</p>

<p>"Why did you betray my confidence?" he cried
threateningly.</p>

<p>"Because I knew you wanted to get your revenge
on her, and this man will help you to it."</p>

<p>The two men glared at each other, and Mr.
Clarke asked:</p>

<p>"Why did she thirst for your life?"</p>

<p>"I held a dangerous secret of hers, and she believed
me dead. When I hunted her down and
threatened to betray her, she tried to kill me. She
pushed me over the bluff, but I was picked up by
a passing yacht, and my life was saved."</p>

<p>"What was that secret?"</p>

<p>"She has promised to pay me richly for keeping
it," sullenly answered the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>"She cannot keep her promise, because she is
not my daughter at all, but an adopted one, and,
finding out that she has attempted many crimes,
I shall cast her off penniless."</p>

<p>"That alters the case. If she cannot pay me
for holding my tongue, I'll take my revenge instead,"
answered Carlos Cisneros, with flashing
eyes. "Sir, Roma is my wife. We were married
secretly at boarding school. Then she tired of
me and went home, while I was ill. When I
hunted her down she attempted to murder me!"</p>

<p>Suddenly they were startled by a tigerish snarl
of rage.</p>

<p>Granny, creeping catlike along the hall, came
suddenly upon the open door, and the group
within her room.</p>

<p>She staggered over the threshold, and glared
like a tiger in the act of springing.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke, still holding the shining necklace
in his hand, cried bitterly:</p>

<p>"Miserable murderess, you are detected in your
crimes! Here is the proof in my hand that you
are the fiend that stole my infant daughter from
her mother's breast, and made her young life one
long torture! Here upon the floor and the bed
are the blood stains that prove you murdered my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
child last night. My God, I only keep my hands
off your throat so that you may tell me what you
have done with my precious dead!" his voice ending
in a hollow groan.</p>

<p>The detected wretch crept closer to Cisneros,
whining:</p>

<p>"Don't let him kill me! I know I deserve it,
but don't let him kill me!"</p>

<p>"Tell him the truth, then!" cried Cisneros, who,
although not a very good man himself, was astonished
at the story he had heard, and felt a keen
disgust for the repulsive, whining old creature.</p>

<p>"What is it you want to know?" she muttered,
gazing fearfully at Clarke.</p>

<p>"Was not Liane Lester my own child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I s'pose it's useless to deny it, now that
you've found your baby's necklace in my trunk."</p>

<p>"And the girl I adopted as my daughter is your
grandchild?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but you'll have to keep her now, and
give her all your gold. You won't never find
Liane no more!" she muttered, with a cunning
leer, as of one demented.</p>

<p>"Tell me why you stole my child!"</p>

<p>"It won't do you any good to find out now. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
won't never come back any more!" she muttered
stubbornly.</p>

<p>He groaned in anguish, but reiterated:</p>

<p>"I insist on having the truth. Answer my question."</p>

<p>"Tell him the truth, you she devil!" growled
Cisneros, pinching her arm as she huddled closer
to his side.</p>

<p>She whined with pain, but she was mastered;
she did not dare persist in her obstinacy.</p>

<p>So she whimpered:</p>

<p>"My daughter Cora stole the baby from your
wife's breast, and she loved it so that I daren't
take it away, lest she should die. So I let her
keep it, and when her own child came she
wouldn't never have naught to do with it, but
clung to the other one, poor, crazy thing! So I
thought I would raise them as twins, but when
Doctor Jay sent me to get one from the foundling
asylum in its place, the devil tempted me to keep
your baby because Cora loved it so, and I put my
own grandchild in your wife's arms, hoping you
wouldn't find out the truth, and that Cora's child
would be a great rich lady. My poor girl went
stark mad, and they put her in the crazy asylum
for life, but I was ashamed of the disgrace. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
told every one she had run away again to be an
actress. And I kept the baby to work for me till
it grew a great girl, with a face like an angel, and
a heart like an angel, too, but somehow I always
hated her, because I had a bad heart!"</p>

<p>"And then your grandchild found out the truth,
and came and told you to kill Liane?" cried her
accuser.</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" she demanded,
shrinking in deadly fear.</p>

<p>"No matter how. You know it is true."</p>

<p>The light of mingled madness and defiance
glared out of the woman's eyes. She growled:</p>

<p>"Well, I had to do it when she told me. Roma
always would have her way, just like Cora, her
mother! I said I hated to do it, the girl was such
a lamb; so sweet, so gentle; but you cannot take
Roma's place from her now, since Liane's dead:
though I hated to do it, she was such a little
angel."</p>

<p>Sophie Nutter burst into violent sobbing, Mr.
Clarke's lips twitched nervously so that he could
not speak, but Cisneros, with flashing eyes, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"So you killed the sweet angel, you fiend from
Hades! Well, I hope you will swing for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
diabolical crimes! A dozen lives like yours would
not pay for one like hers! Come, now, we want
to know where you hid her body."</p>

<p>She glanced at him resentfully, answering, to
his surprise:</p>

<p>"They may hang me if they want to! I don't
love my life since I killed Liane! I miss her so,
sweet lamb, I miss her so! I thought I hated her,
and I used her cruelly, but when she was dead,
when I saw the blood on her white face, I loved
her! I kissed her little cold hand. I told her I
was sorry I had done it, and wished I could bring
her back to life! She was good to me, little angel,
and I hate Roma because she made me kill her!
I told her it was not right to kill her, but she
hounded me to it! Now she can keep Liane's
place at Cliffdene, but I don't want to see her any
more. Cruel, wicked Roma, that made me a
murderess!"</p>

<p>She rocked her body miserably to and fro,
maundering hoarsely on, while Sophie's vehement
sobbing filled the room as she recalled last night,
when she had looked her last on Liane's still,
white face, cruelly fooled by the old woman's lies.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke cried, with fierce, despairing anger:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>"No more of this paltering, woman! Tell us
where to find Liane's body!"</p>

<p>To his joy and amazement, the half-crazed
woman answered:</p>

<p>"Roma told me to throw her in the river or the
sewer, but she was so sweet I could not do it! I
hid her in an old cellar, very dark and cold, and
when I begged her to speak to me, she opened
her sweet eyes again! Come with me, and I will
show you!"</p>

<p>Almost afraid to hope that she spoke the truth,
they followed the half-crazed woman to an old
unoccupied house several blocks away, and there,
indeed, they found Liane, faintly breathing and
half frozen, lying on the floor of a cold, dark cellar,
half covered with some scraps of carpet that
granny had laid over her in her late repentance.</p>

<p>Again Sophie's passionate sobs broke out,
echoed dismally by granny, who muttered pleadingly:</p>

<p>"Don't take her from me if she lives; don't give
me Roma to live with! I hate her now, the wicked
wretch, and I'd rather have my little angel, Liane!
I'll never beat her again; no, never! Do you hear
me promise, Liane?"</p>

<p>But there was no recognition in the half-open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
eyes of the poor girl, as they searched their faces,
and, pushing granny sharply aside, Edmund
Clarke took up his daughter in his arms and bore
her back to Mrs. Brinkley's, while Carlos Cisneros
was sent in haste for a physician.</p>

<p>Granny, seeming to have no fear of arrest for
her dreadful crimes, hovered anxiously about,
eager as any to aid in undoing her evil work.</p>

<p>Liane was laid in Sophie's soft white bed, and
the girl said tenderly:</p>

<p>"I will nurse her myself, and no one knows better
than I how to care for her, for I used to be a
nurse in a hospital."</p>

<p>"Keep the old woman out," said Mr. Clarke
sternly, and she went back to her own rooms, sobbing
like a beaten child.</p>

<p>The doctor was soon on the scene, and he
looked very grave, indeed, when he had made his
examination.</p>

<p>"It is a serious case," he said. "There has been
a severe blow on the head that stunned her, and
all her faculties are benumbed. How long this
state will last I cannot tell, but I hope I shall
bring her around all right."</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke rejoiced exceedingly at even this
small ray of hope, and, engaging the doctor to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
until his return, set out impatiently to Devereaux's
house to tax Roma with her crimes.</p>

<p>He was burning with impatience. He could not
wait, he was so eager to tell wicked Roma the
truth that all her schemes had failed, and that, by
Heaven's good mercy, Liane would be restored to
her parents' hearts, while she, the wicked usurper,
would be driven out to live with the old hag who
had helped her in her nefarious plot against his
daughter's life.</p>

<p>He took with him Carlos Cisneros, and, unknown
to them both, Granny Jenks followed in
their wake, cunningly curious to see how Roma
took her downfall.</p>

<p>At nightfall they reached the Devereaux mansion,
just a few moments after the ceremony that
had made Roma the wife of the young millionaire.
Indeed, Lyde and the other two witnesses
had just withdrawn from the apartment, on
Roma's request to be left alone with her husband.</p>

<p>She looked up at him with shining, love-filled
eyes, murmuring:</p>

<p>"Please kneel down by me, Jesse, so that I may
put my arms around your neck and die with my
head upon your breast."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>He pitied the rash girl so much that he could
not refuse her anything in her dying hour. He
obeyed her wish, and held his arm around her
with her bright head on his bosom, expecting
every moment to be her last.</p>

<p>But the minutes flew, and Roma showed not a
sign of dying. Instead, her breathing was very
strong and regular, and she tightened her arms
about him, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Oh, my husband, would you be glad if life
could be granted to me now, that I might live,
your happy bride?"</p>

<p>"Do not let us dwell on the impossible, Roma,"
he answered kindly.</p>

<p>"But why impossible, Jesse, dearest? I am not
really certain of dying. I do not feel like it now,
at all, and perhaps the dose I took was not really
sufficient to kill me! Now that I am your wife, it
seems as if a new elixir of life is coursing through
my veins, and I long to live for your precious
sake! Oh, surely you do not wish me to die!"</p>

<p>Here was a dilemma, certainly. Jesse Devereaux,
holding the warm, palpitating figure in
his arms, did not know how to answer her piteous
appeal, and he was saved the necessity, for at the
moment the door opened, admitting Lyde, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
by Edmund Clarke, with granny, who had
forced herself in, bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Lyde had told him hurriedly what had happened,
and he had asked to see Roma; hence the
intrusion.</p>

<p>The bride still clung fondly to her husband,
and when they entered, she exclaimed, in strong,
natural accents:</p>

<p>"Papa, dear, congratulate us. We are married."</p>

<p>"So I have heard," he replied, with keen sarcasm,
adding: "I was told that you were dying,
but you do not look much like it. Your cheeks are
red, your eyes bright and clear, and your voice
does not falter."</p>

<p>Roma actually laughed out softly and triumphantly,
saying:</p>

<p>"I have just told my dear husband that I do
not feel like dying at all, and that love and happiness
have given me a new elixir of life."</p>

<p>Edmund Clarke would have spared exposing
her if it had been really her dying hour, but he
saw that she had grossly deceived Devereaux, so
he returned, with bitter sarcasm:</p>

<p>"As you feel so strong and happy, I have some
exciting news to break to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>"News, papa?" sweetly.</p>

<p>"Do not call me papa," he answered bitterly.
"You know well that I am not related to you,
and that your discovery of the truth has caused
you to attempt the most heinous crimes to keep
my real daughter from coming into her birthright.
I am here to tell you that your plot to kill
Doctor Jay and myself has been discovered. Your
attempted murder of Liane Lester came near success,
but, happily, she has revived, and Granny
Jenks, your wicked grandmother, has confessed
that you were substituted in her place, and that
Liane is my own child!"</p>

<p>"Heavens!" cried Devereaux, his arms falling
from around Roma; but she clung to him, exclaiming
passionately:</p>

<p>"I am your wife! No matter what he charges,
I am your wife; do not forget that, Jesse!"</p>

<p>"And no doubt you pretended that you had
swallowed poison, just to entrap him in your
toils!" cried Edmund Clarke scornfully, while
Devereaux, looking at her as she clung to him,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Is this true, Roma?"</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed with defiance as she answered,
rising, quickly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it is true. I only swallowed some colored
water to frighten you all, and to make you
marry me, because I loved you so dearly! You
must forgive me, my darling husband, for you
cannot alter anything now!"</p>

<p>He recoiled from her touch with loathing, and
Mr. Clarke broke in:</p>

<p>"Do not trouble yourself over her words, Jesse,
for she has no claim upon you. She has already
a living husband&mdash;one whom she tried to murder,
to put him out of her way, but he is here to testify
to the truth of my words."</p>

<p>Through the open door stepped the wronged
husband with a manly air, saying to startled
Roma:</p>

<p>"Every man's hand is against you but mine,
Roma, and even my heart recoils at your wickedness;
but I love you still, and if you will repent of
your sins and promise to lead a better life, I will
take you back, and our old dream of a dramatic
life shall be fulfilled."</p>

<p>It was a noble touch in the life of a man who
had not been very good, but who was at least
Roma's superior in everything, and she could not
help but recognize it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>Beaten, foiled, in everything, she turned to the
man she had wronged, saying:</p>

<p>"It is worth all the rest to find such a constant
heart."</p>

<p>She laughed mirthlessly, mockingly, and left
the room, scowling as she passed at Granny Jenks,
huddled against the door, holding back her skirts
from contact with her granddaughter, while she
muttered: "I don't love you any more, and I wish
never to see you again. I am going back to
Liane."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WHEN THE CLOUDS ROLLED BY.</p>


<p>It was Christmas morning at Cliffdene, and
snow lay deep upon the ground, while the boom of
the sea, lashed into fury by howling winter winds,
filled the air, but within all was light, and warmth,
and joy.</p>

<p>A few days ago the Clarkes had come home,
with their daughter Liane restored to health after
weary weeks of illness and nervous prostration
from her terrible beating at Granny Jenks' hands
and the subsequent exposure in the cold cellar.</p>

<p>They called her Liane still, because the name
of Roma was associated with so many unpleasant
things that they had no wish for her to bear it.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke had spent a thrilling hour making
clear to his wife all the happenings of the past
eighteen years, but she had borne the shock better
than he expected. Her love for Roma, never
as strong as the maternal love, though carefully
fostered, died an instant death when she heard
the story of the girl's terrible crimes. Bitter tears
she shed, indeed, but they were for her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
daughter's sufferings in those cruel years while
she had been kept back from her own.</p>

<p>"We will make it up to her, my darling, by
devotion now," cried her husband, kissing away
her tears; then they hastened to the bedside of
Liane, for she could not be moved yet from her
humble abode.</p>

<p>After several days of unconsciousness she began
to improve, and in a week was able to have
the truth carefully broken to her by her own
mother, who with Sophie Nutter shared the task
of nursing her back to health. Doctor Jay was
sent for to assist with his medical skill, and great
was his joy to find her restored to her own, and so
beautiful and worthy, in spite of the rearing she
had had from brutal granny, the miserable old
hag, who was so crushed by the contempt and
scorn of every one that she sought consolation
in the bottle and drank herself to death in a week,
expiring miserably in a hospital.</p>

<p>As soon as Liane was well enough to see a visitor
Mrs. Carrington called.</p>

<p>"Do you remember me, my dear?" she asked,
and Liane murmured:</p>

<p>"I sold you gloves."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and fascinated me at the same time. I
have been in love with you ever since."</p>

<p>Lyde wondered at the sudden blush on the girl's
cheek as Liane thought within herself that she
would be glad if Lyde's brother only loved her
also.</p>

<p>As for him, of course, she did not see him till
she left her room, but flowers came for her every
day&mdash;great red roses, breathing the language of
love&mdash;and on the day before they went to Cliffdene,
her devoted mamma said:</p>

<p>"Dear, if you feel well enough, I should like
you to send a kind little note to Jesse Devereaux,
thanking him for the flowers he has been sending
every day."</p>

<p>"I will write," Liane replied, with a blush and
a quickened heartbeat, and her fond mother
added:</p>

<p>"Jesse is a fine young man, and admires you
very much."</p>

<p>When he received the note, so neatly and gracefully
written, without a mistake in wording or
spelling, Devereaux was puzzled.</p>

<p>It was certainly not like the writing of the letter
in which she had rejected him. He concluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
that her mother or her maid Sophie had written
it.</p>

<p>"Poor girl, she will have to have private instructors
to repair the defects in her education,"
he thought.</p>

<p>A few days before Christmas the Clarkes bade
a kind farewell to the good-natured Mrs. Brinkley
and Lizzie White, and returned to Stonecliff,
whither the news had preceded them in letters to
friends.</p>

<p>Devereaux was at the station to bid them farewell,
and by the most open hinting he managed to
secure from Mrs. Clarke an invitation to spend
Christmas with them at Cliffdene.</p>

<p>He arrived on Christmas morning, and was
presently shown into the holly-wreathed library,
where Liane was sitting alone, exquisitely
gowned in dark-blue silk, from which her fair
face arose like a beautiful lily.</p>

<p>Devereaux's greeting was joyous, but Liane
was cold and constrained. She could not forget
how he had snubbed her in Boston when she was
only a poor working girl.</p>

<p>But they had not exchanged a dozen words before
they were interrupted by the unexpected entrance
of Dolly Dorr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>Dolly had been staying at her own home ever
since Roma's flight with her husband, and she
had been having a hard battle with her conscience,
which culminated in the triumph of the
right; hence her presence here to-day.</p>

<p>Dolly made her little curtsy, and began bashfully:</p>

<p>"Miss Clarke, and Mr. Devereaux, I have
wronged you both, and I have come now to try to
make amends."</p>

<p>They gazed at her in silent surprise, and she
hurried on, eager to tell her story and escape their
reproachful eyes:</p>

<p>"Miss Liane, when you went away to Boston,
I got a letter addressed to you from the post
office, and Miss Roma opened it, and we read it
together. Then she bribed me to answer it, and I
guess Mr. Devereaux has the ugly letter she made
me write. Here's yours, and&mdash;please forgive me.
I am sorry I behaved so badly," tossing a letter
into Liane's lap and flying precipitately from the
apartment.</p>

<p>Liane opened the letter bewilderedly, and read,
with Devereaux's eager eyes upon her face, and
her cheeks scarlet, his passionate love letter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
proposal of marriage. As she finished, he said
eagerly:</p>

<p>"I received a rejection in answer to that letter,
but, Liane, dearest, may I ask you to reconsider
it?"</p>

<p>Her lovely eyes met his in a happy, eloquent
glance, and, springing to her side, he wound his
arms about her, drawing her close to his breast,
while their yearning lips met in a long, clinging
kiss.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
